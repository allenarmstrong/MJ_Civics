<h2>Scenarios: Answers Text Version</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Imagine you are the president of the United States. Choose how you would react to each situation.</p>
<h3>Scenario 1</h3> 
<p>(image: Map of Caribbean with major countries and territories labeled, including southern region of United States)</p>
<p>The people of a colony near the United States are under the rule of a faraway country. You hear reports that the ruling country treats its people badly and they want independence. The people have revolted and set up their own government. Violence erupted between those loyal to the ruling country and the rebels. You sent a battleship to stay nearby to protect Americans staying there. The ruling country is angry that the United States seems to support the revolt. Then you receive news that the U.S. battleship suffered an explosion and sunk.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Do nothing except bring back Americans from the conflict area.</li>
<li>Ask Congress for permission to send troops to help end the conflict.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Feedback for A</strong><br>President McKinley would not have agreed with you. In 1898, Cuba was owned by and in revolt against Spain. Americans thought Spain's continued efforts to control other lands was harmful to U.S. interests. Congress gave President McKinley permission to intervene by sending troops to help the Cubans. As a result, Spain declared war on the United States.</p>
<p>Fighting between the two countries happened in two areas—the Caribbean and the Pacific. After nearly four months, the war was over. Spain suffered major defeats. In the peace treaty that ended the war, the United States gained control of Cuba, the Philippine islands, Guam, and Puerto Rico. On the foreign policy spectrum, the U.S. response was an act of both intervention and imperialism. It took control of several areas. Guam and Puerto Rico are still U.S. territories today.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback for B</strong><br>President McKinley made the same choice. In 1898, Cuba was owned by and in revolt against Spain. Americans thought Spain's continued efforts to control other lands was harmful to U.S. interests. Congress gave President McKinley permission to intervene by sending troops to help the Cubans. As a result, Spain declared war on the United States.</p>

<h3>Scenario 2</h3>
<p>(Image: map of Europe)</p>
<p>Your country has grown, and trade with countries around the globe is booming. Leaders of one country in Europe start taking action to increase the country's territory. The country bullies others into giving up territory and invading with military elsewhere. The events are happening far away from your country, yet they are hurting many countries that are friends and trade partners.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Nothing—the country is not invading the United States.</li>
<li>Send people and supplies to help the countries in trouble.</li>
<li>Send troops to help fight against the invading country and restore peace.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong><br>
President Franklin D. Roosevelt would have agreed with all of these actions, just at different times. World War II broke out in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France declared war on Germany. They were frustrated with Adolf Hitler's imperialism against other countries in Europe. Japan had been in conflict with the Soviet Union and China. Soon Japan allied with Germany, and the war grew to involve Europe and Asia. At first, the United States' response was isolationism. It did not want to get involved in another world war so far away. However, the war soon disrupted trade and began to hurt the United States.</p>
<p>The United States began sending supplies to its allies, especially Britain. The president met with the British prime minister to establish goals for what should happen after the war, trying diplomacy. However, it was not until December 1941 that the United States officially entered the war. The Japanese attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Soon after, President Roosevelt declared war on Japan and then Germany.</p>

<h3>Scenario 3</h3>
<p>(Image: political map of North and South Korea, with surrounding countries labeled)</p>
<p>One country has invaded its southern neighbor. The two countries used to be one, but they split after a major war. Your military and leaders have been in the southern country, helping it set up a democratic government. A rival country to the United States has helped set up a communist government in the northern country. Now the communist leadership is intent on reuniting the countries under its government. Many Americans see this as a threat to freedom and democracy.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Nothing—the country is not invading the United States.</li>
<li>Send troops to help fight against the invading country.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback for A</strong><br>
<p>President Harry Truman would not have agreed with you. At the end of World War II, Korea was divided into North Korea and South Korea. The Korean people themselves did not have a say in this decision. The U.S. military occupied South Korea, and it set up a democratic government. North Korea, occupied by the Soviet Union, set up a communist government. The United States and Soviet Union were the two most powerful countries after the Second World War. This began a time of intense competition between them known as the Cold War. Each built up its weapons and military, fearing an attack from the other.</p>
<p>With the support of the Soviet Union, North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950. Its leaders wanted to reunify as one Korea under a communist government. Many Americans feared the spread of communism, which they saw as a threat to freedom. President Truman, working with the United Nations, sent the U.S. military to intervene. In 1953, the war was over. South Korea and North Korea remain separate to this day. However, soldiers continue to guard the border, including U.S. soldiers. The Soviet Union broke up into separate countries in 1991. Several countries in the world are still communist today, including North Korea and Cuba.</p>

<h3>Scenario 4</h3>
<p>(Image: political map centered on Rwanda, with surrounding countries labeled)</p>
<p>You hear that the plane of a president was shot down about a month ago. He was trying to bring peace to people fighting within his country. His death started a new wave of violence between the people there. The country is far away and does not have a strong relationship with the United States.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Nothing—the situation does not affect the United States.</li>
<li>Send people and supplies to help the victims.</li>
<li>Send troops to help bring peace.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong><br>
President Bill Clinton did not act, and he regrets the decision. The real-life events mark a failure of international leadership. The country of Rwanda gained independence from Belgium in 1962. Two main groups of people in Rwanda competed for years for power. The Hutu and Tutsi peoples distrusted and feared each other. The Hutus took control of the new government. They fought a bloody civil war with the Tutsis from 1990-1993.  When a peace agreement was signed, people from other countries, including UN workers, were leaving Rwanda.</p>
<p>Many in Rwanda did not support the peace treaty. In April 1994, the Hutu president died when his plane was shot down. The Hutus planned genocide against the Tutsis. Genocide means the intentional killing or attempt to kill an entire group of people. Between 500,000 and one million Tutsis died in violent attacks that year. Some UN peacekeepers were in Rwanda, but they were powerless to stop the violence. Information about the bloodshed was slow to reach world leaders. Even then, many were reluctant to act. What happened in Rwanda is a lesson that international cooperation can fail. Today, the UN assists the survivors and teaches people about Rwanda to prevent such horror in the future.</p>

<h3>Scenario 5</h3>
<p>(Image: political map of Afghanistan with surrounding countries labeled)</p>
<p>You receive word that your country has been attacked. As you learn more information, you find out that those responsible belong to a group that controls another country by force. The particular group has attacked before on U.S. territory and the territory of countries that are allies. Americans want justice, but finding the specific leaders will be difficult. Not all of your allies support invading the country.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Nothing—focus on helping the survivors of the attack for now.</li>
<li>Continue reaching out to allies for help in finding those responsible.</li>
<li>Ask Congress for permission to invade the country with the U.S. military.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong><br> President George W. Bush would have agreed with all of these actions, and did indeed take all of them. On September 11, 2001, members of a terrorist organization attacked the United States. Nearly 3,000 people died, including hundreds of rescue workers. The members of NATO declared the attack as an offense against all members, and most pledged support to the United States. Many of the people responsible for the attack and their supporters were hiding in and in control of Afghanistan.</p> 
<p>The United States, with the help of many of its allies, invaded the country and removed the terrorists from power. The United Nations later sent peacekeepers to help secure the capital city. However, work in Afghanistan continues over 10 years later. The country's geography and people upset with the U.S. invasion are difficult challenges. U.S. forces finally found Osama bin Laden in 2011. He was the main person who led the September 11, 2001 attacks.</p>
