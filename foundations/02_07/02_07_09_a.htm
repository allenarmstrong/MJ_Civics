<h4>Example Post and Replies:</h4>
<p><strong>Discussion Prompt:</strong></p>
<p>What is your favorite pet?</p>
<p><strong>Sample Student Response:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Shane, and my favorite pet is a cat because they are independent, you do not have to take them for a walk, and they take care of the mice. They are better than fish because they can play with you.</p> 
<p><strong>Sample Agree Student Reply:</strong></p>
    <p>I agree with Shane. I would also like to add that cats are very playful. My cat likes to play with a ball of yarn and chase it around the house.</p>
    <p><strong>Sample Disagree Student Reply:</strong></p>
    <p>I agree with part of your posting, Shane. I support you on having a favorite pet, but I feel differently about cats. Let me explain why dogs are better than cats. I agree that having a cat saves you time because you do not have to walk it, but I enjoy walking my dog. Walking a dog takes you outside, lets you enjoy the fresh air, and gets you some exercise.</li>
      </ul>
