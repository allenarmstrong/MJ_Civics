<h2>Flowchart Text Version</h2>
<p>The presentation shows a flow chart with six boxes, connecting a photograph of the Capitol Building to a photograph of a hand catching money as it falls from the sky. Each of the boxes in the flow chart contains steps that lead from government policy to economic growth. The process is summarized below.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Imagine that Congress creates a federal grant for students seeking a medical degree.</li> 
  <li>Members of Congress may have to raise taxes or reduce spending on other programs to fund the grant.</li>
  <li>The grant program would create jobs because the government would hire people to manage the grant program. This includes managing paperwork and sending funds to the universities.</li>
  <li>More students would likely seek a medical degree since money is available to pay their education costs.</li>
  <li>Universities would hire more instructors and staff to handle the growth.</li> 
  <li>Eventually, there would be more people working in the medical field. They would contribute new ideas for disease prevention, proper health management, and treatment options. The grant program contributes to overall economic growth.</li>
</ol>
