<h2>Imagine Yourself Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Imagine you go to school and see your friend wearing something interesting on her upper arm. It looks like a black band with a peace symbol on it. You ask her about it. She explains that the armband she wears shows support for world peace. She is against war and especially any conflict overseas where the government sends U.S. soldiers. The band is black to show grief for soldiers and others who have died in war.</p>
<p>Looking around you notice a few other students wearing the armband. A good friend of yours has one on and you notice he is explaining it to another student. From his backpack, he retrieves another armband and gives it to the student, who then puts it on. You start to think that maybe you should wear one too. Supporting world peace sounds like a good thing.</p>
<p>At lunch, you ask another student wearing an armband if you could have an extra one. You wear it and decide to wear it each day to show that you, too, support peace.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of days, the number of students wearing armbands grows. In classes, other students ask about the armband. Teachers ask you to remove it or wear it under your shirt because it is distracting the class. One student replies that it is just like a piece of jewelry or wearing hair a certain way and should not be a problem. After all, the students are supporting peace, not conflict!</p>
<p>At the end of the week, a teacher sends you and a couple friends to the principal's office. The principal is the head of the school. The principal says that the armbands are a distraction and must be left at home. Some students have been arguing in the halls about the government and decisions about military action. The principal says that while it is great you support peace, the support is creating conflict in school.</p>
<p>Your friends call you that night and say to wear the armband. Your friends say that you have the right to "freedom of speech" and that the armband does not hurt anyone. You worry about getting in trouble. Yet you also want to show support for your friends. You agree that wearing an armband should not be a problem. If students are fighting, it is their own fault.</p>
<p>The next day, a teacher sends you and other students wearing the armband right away to the principal. The principal tells you that you are suspended from school for breaking the rules and disrupting learning. Your parents have to leave work and pick you up. You know they will not be happy.</p>
