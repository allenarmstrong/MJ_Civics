<h2>Investigate Sheet</h2>

<ol>
<li>List at least five issues in your community. Circle the two that interest you most.<br /><br /></li>
<li>It's time to investigate! Use this chart to take notes as you research. Use the library, Internet, family and friends, and trusted community members. Talk to at least three trusted adults about the issues you research. These people may suggest good ideas and websites for information. One example would be your city or county government website. Be sure to note where you find information in your chart.<br /><br /></li>
