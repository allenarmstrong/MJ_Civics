             A government and its people have a basic agreement that is not found in a written law.<br /><br />The government agrees to keep the people and property safe from those who break the law. The people agree to give the government the powers needed to keep that agreement. This is called the social contract.</div>

            Decisions will and should be based on what the majority of people want to happen. However, those people who do not agree with the majority have rights, too. The majority in any situation must remember and respect this fact. The laws must protect the rights of all people, no matter what their opinions.</div>
