<h2>Netiquette</h2>

<p>Etiquette (called netiquette in cyberspace) exists in the wide world of computers. Perhaps just as important as &quot;real world manners,&#8221; netiquette email rules are necessary because readers draw inferences from your  words rather than nonverbal body language.</p>

  <p>You may not use your school email account for sending or receiving personal emails which are not related to your school work. Be aware that teachers and administrators have complete access to your emails so nothing you do with your school email account is considered private. Any inappropriate  use of email will result in administrative action. </p>

  <p> Although there is no one set of rules for writing and sending emails, here are a few rules you are to follow.</p>

<ul>

 <li>Email messages should be written in a more  formal manner than instant messaging but not as rigid as a business letter.</li>

 <li>Grammar and punctuation should be consistent with rules of English. For example, capitalize the first letter of a sentence, correct spelling, use punctuation marks, etc. </li>

 <li>Do not capitalize all letters when writing as this means you are shouting! </li>

 <li>Refrain from using abbreviations or use sparingly as your teacher may not be able to decipher what it means. (For example, TIA&#8212;Thanks in Advance) </li>

 <li>You may use emoticons to express feelings, but remember there is no substitute for a  clearly written email. </li>

 <li>Always sign your first and last name to your emails so your teacher knows with whom they are working. </li>

 <li>Please  do not send chain letters or spam  material of any nature to your teachers or fellow students. This is most inconsiderate! </li>

 <li>Last but not least, think before you send  an email. You are unable to stop the email after it has been sent. </li>

  </ul>
