<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Collaboration is an important part of determining  options when a community group or government must make a choice. Exploring all the possible options can help the leaders and members make the choice with the best outcome.</p>

<p>Imagine you and your partners work as part of a citizen team seeking to advise government and community groups on making choices. Your team's task is to brainstorm the wants of a particular community and its options in a certain topic. Your team will determine as a group the best choice, trade-offs, and opportunity cost of that choice for the community.</p>

<h3>Step One: Identify the Community and Wants</h3>

<p>All members of your team should explore the news through newspapers, websites, radio, or other means. Look for articles and information about the wants of a whole community, such as a city that wants to build a new football stadium as well as a new high school. Find as many of these current issues as possible. Decide as a team which community to focus on. It is best to find one community for which you can identify several "wants." You should identify a community with at least two "wants."</p>
 
 <p>You may use the discussion area or a Web 2.0 Tool to organize your team's work. Be sure you have parent and instructor permission before using websites or communicating outside the course. The first section of the <strong>Collaboration Assessment Guide</strong> will help you organize your team.</p> 
 
 <h3>Step Two: Conduct Background Research</h3>
 
 <p>As a team, find the answers to the following questions. You can look for more news articles about each item and read them carefully. You can talk with trusted adults to brainstorm this information as well. Use the <strong>Advisory Team Research Chart</strong> to organize the information for Steps 1-5.</p>
 
 <ul>
 <li>How much money will the community need to spend on each "want"?</li>
 <li>How many people in the community will each "want" affect?</li>
 <li>Whom will likely benefit from each want? Who might suffer?</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Step Three: Determine All the Possible Options</h3>

<p>Imagine (even if it is not the case) that the community cannot afford all of the wants you have identified. As a team, discuss and make a list of all the possible options for the community. Use the <strong>Options List</strong> to document your discussion.</p>

<h3>Step Four: Make a choice</h3>

<p>If the community were counting on your team to make the best choice, what would you choose? Discuss as a team and explain why you made that choice. Use the <strong>Advisory Team Research Chart</strong> to assist you in your discussion.</p>

<p>Explain the consequences of that choice as well. What are the trade-offs? What would have been your second choice? What is the opportunity cost?</p>

<h3>Step Five: Prepare Advisory for the Community</h3>

<p>Your team should prepare to present your research to the affected community group or government. Create one group presentation that includes all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>list of community "wants"</li>
<li>chart of research related to each want</li>
<li>list of possible options for the community</li>
<li>the team's recommended choice and reasons for it</li>
<li>description of trade-offs and opportunity cost of the recommended choice</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step Six: Submit to Instructor</h3>

<p>There are <strong>two parts</strong> to your work in the collaboration activity. View the Grading Rubrics before completing and submitting this activity.</p>
