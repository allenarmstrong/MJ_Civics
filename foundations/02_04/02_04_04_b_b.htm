<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>
<p>The Founding Fathers had an important task in creating a government for the new nation. They found that their first plan did not meet the needs of the country. Therefore, they replaced it with the U.S Constitution. What do you think is important for a government to do?</p>
<p>Imagine you and your team are the founding leaders of an island government in the Atlantic Ocean. The island has about 50,000 people living there. You and your team wish to create an independent government for the nation. In this activity, you will create a constitution for your island nation.</p>
<h3>Step 1—Identify Government Beliefs</h3>
<p>What does your team believe about government? What principles should guide how it operates? Your team should review the early lessons in the Foundations module to guide your ideas. Make a list of your team's beliefs. Explain why they are important.</p>
<p>You may use the discussion area or a Web 2.0 Tool to organize your team's work. Be sure you have parent and instructor permission before using websites or communicating outside the course. The first section of the Collaboration Assessment Guide will help you organize your team.</p>
<h3>Step 2—Identify Your Island Nation's Concerns </h3>
<p>In your team, brainstorm the issues that would be of most concern to residents. What should your government do to address these concerns? You may use the Brainstorming Template to help collect your ideas. Be sure to give credit to each team member's ideas.</p>
<h3>Step 3—Prepare Island Constitution</h3>
<p>Now your team should be ready to create your island constitution. Use the following format to write your plan in a word processing document. Plan with your team who will create the document and how you will share it with each other.</p>
<p>Team members: _______________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Preamble</strong><br /> 
We, the people of (island name), believe that government should have the following principles (a basic idea or underlying assumption for how something should work):<br />
(List and describe at least five principles.)</p>
<p><strong>Articles</strong><br />
(Each article should describe a specific function of your government. You should have at least three articles.)</p>
<p><strong>Amendments</strong><br />
(Describe what the process will be if the island's people want a change to the constitution.)</p>
<h3>Step 4–Share and Discuss Your Island Constitution</h3>
<p>As a team, share and discuss the draft of your island constitution. Share it with trusted adults to get their input and ideas. They may be able to point out issues your team did not consider. The questions below will help your team analyze your plan. Be sure to discuss any changes with your team before editing the document.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you clearly describe your government's principles?</li>
  <li>Do the functions of government match your principles?</li>
  <li>Do you address the concerns of the people?</li>
  <li>Do you have a method for passing new laws?</li>
  <li>Do you have a way to enforce the laws?</li>
  <li>Do you describe who has authority and how they get their positions?</li>
  <li>Do the people have a role in the government?</li>
  <li>Do you have a way to settle disputes over the laws?</li>
  <li>Do you have a way for the constitution to be changed?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5—Prepare Call to Action</h3>
<p>As a team, choose the format you will use to present information on your issue. Your goal is to convince people to help one of these groups. It should tell them how they could help and why it is a good idea. As a team, create one of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>website</li>
    <li>poster</li>
    <li>pamphlet</li>
    <li>news or magazine feature</li>
    <li>video or podcast</li>
    <li>other format approved by instructor</li>
  </ul>
<p>Be sure your Call to Action contains the names of all your team members.</p>
