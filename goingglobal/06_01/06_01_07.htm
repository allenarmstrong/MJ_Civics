<h1>Can Governments Change?</h1>
<div class="right img"><img src="images/06_01_07.jpg" alt="European Union Member Map" width="300" height="321" /></div> 
<p>They certainly can change. New laws, new people in power, and conflicts such as war can lead to a different government structure. A monarch ruled the American colonies until independence from Great Britain. The United States began as a confederation. Problems arose that led to creating a federation under the <span class="tooltip"> U.S. Constitution<span><strong> U.S. Constitution:</strong> plan detailing the structure, functions, and powers of the government of the United States, also known as the Constitution</span></span>. Canada and Switzerland began as confederations. Laws in each have led them to operate as federations. As new people come to power with new ideas, they will create laws that may alter the way government works. This is why two nations, both described as federal representative democracies, can look very different in how they operate.</p>
<p>The <span class="tooltip">constitution<span><strong>Constitution:</strong> a plan, or outline, for government, such as the U.S. Constitution</span></span> of a nation, if it has one, can organize the basic structure of government. However, not all constitutions last. A war, for example, could lead to a brand new constitution. The United States has built the ability to change, or <span class="tooltip">amend<span><strong>Amend:</strong> to make a change to improve or correct something</span></span>, its organization right into its constitution. In contrast, France has had many constitutions since the 1790s with different forms of monarchy and republic. The current French constitution, however, has an amendment process and has been in place since 1958.</p>
<p>France is part of the EU, or European Union. The European Union is a partnership of 27 nations mostly in Europe. It formed to help promote trade by removing limitations to trade and travel among its members. While some people say these nations have formed a confederation, many members of the EU object to that idea. Member nations are very concerned about keeping their traditional identities and culture. Even today, the way nations organize and create new governments is undergoing change.</p>
