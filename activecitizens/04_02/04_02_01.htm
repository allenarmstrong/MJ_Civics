The Supreme Court ruled that the California "three strikes" law was constitutional. This law requires the state court to give a much longer jail or prison sentence to those who are convicted of serious crimes three or more times. The Supreme Court ruled that this law is not cruel or unusual punishment, banned by the 8th Amendment.
