<h1>Why Are Juries Important?</h1>
<div class="right img"><img src="images/03_07_05_a.jpg" alt="Jury" /><br /><span class="imgNote">&copy; 2011 AP Images</span></div> 
<p>It might be faster and easier to have one judge determine the outcome of a trial, but it may not be the best way to ensure <span class="tooltip">justice<span><strong>Justice:</strong> fairness under the law</span></span>. The <span class="tooltip">Founding Fathers<span><strong>Founding Fathers:</strong> name given to the early leaders of the United States who helped design the nation's government</span></span> felt strongly about judging people fairly under the law. With a jury, multiple people consider the facts of the case. The judge cannot tell them what verdict to give. As fellow citizens, they are equals under the law to the people on trial. They have nothing to gain by selecting one verdict over another, and so are more likely to arrive at a fair and just verdict. The <span class="tooltip">Bill of Rights<span><strong>Bill of Rights:</strong> the first 10 amendments to the Constitution</span></span> protects the right of citizens to a jury trial. The 6th and 7th Amendments protect citizens' right to a jury trial.</p> 
<p>A juror has great responsibility in the trial process.  He or she must answer questions honestly during the selection process. The juror must listen carefully to all evidence in the case, even when cases go on for weeks or months. He or she must participate in the deliberations and ask questions if anything is unclear. The jurors must agree to a verdict based on the evidence of the case, not personal feelings or a desire to finish the trial quickly. The people involved in the case count on the jury members to hear their side and make a fair decision. Jurors should recognize how important they are to the court and act appropriately. For example, jurors must not talk to reporters during the trial to protect their fair judgment on the case. Sometimes a judge will <span class="tooltip">sequester<span><strong>Sequester:</strong> to remove or set apart, such as jury members isolated from other people and the media during a trial</span></span> the jury to make sure they are not influenced by news reports on the case.</p>
