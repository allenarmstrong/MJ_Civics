<h2>Chart Text Version</h2>
<p>(Image: A flow chart containing two circles.  The inner circle shows the flow of Money to Businesses to Money to Households back to Money. Then the outer circle shows the flow of Resources and Labor to Businesses to Goods and Services to Households back to Resources and Labor.)</p>
<p>Think of the circles as water pipes. What happens when there is too much water pressure? The pipes could burst. If there is too little water pressure, the water in the pipes gets stale and the pipes may rot. Just as you would want a steady flow of water in the pipes, the Federal Reserve aims to keep a steady flow of money, resources, and goods throughout the economy.</p>
