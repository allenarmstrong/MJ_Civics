<h2>The President's Other Duties Text Version</h2>
<p>[Narrator] The President makes a speech each year to Congress. It is the duty of the President to inform Congress of the state of the union. In other words, 
how the federal government is running.</p>
<p>[President] Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union.</p> 
<p>[Narrator] The President also tells Congress what they can do to help the government. The President may recommend bills for Congress to pass. These are bills the President will sign into law because the President believes they will help the country. The President is our representative in the world.</p>
<p>Our President meets with the leaders of other countries, such as Russia, Ghana, and Mexico. The President can make agreements with these leaders. These agreements are called treaties. The Senate must approve these treaties. Many treaties are for peace and others may be for trade, territory, or some other common interest.</p>
<p>The President is the Commander in Chief or leader of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and when necessary, the National Guard.  Our nation's military takes their orders from the President. The President visits many of the military bases to show support for the troops and to make sure the military is ready to protect our country.</p> 
<p>As Commander in Chief, the President can authorize the use of military troops overseas without declaring war. To declare war officially, the President must get the approval of Congress. To protect our country at home, the President oversees the FBI, CIA, INS and other federal law enforcement agencies. These agencies help the President carry out the laws of the nation by enforcing them. They're like a police department for the whole country.</p>
<p>"I see now that my uncle, Tio Roberto, was right. The President is very powerful and very busy."</p>
