<h2>Resources: Answers Text Version</h2>
<h3>Map 1–North America</h3>
<p>(Image: Political map of North America that shows national borders. Greenland, Central America, Caribbean countries, the oceans, Hudson Bay, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea are labeled. Image has a caption stating "This is a political map of North America. Note the international borders and names of the countries that are part of the continent.")</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Which country has the greatest amount of land area in North America?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><strong>Canada</strong></li>
<li>Greenland</li>
<li>Mexico</li>
<li>United States</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Canada is the largest country in North America, followed by the United States. However, the United States is the largest country in North America by population. This means the United States has the most people living within its borders.</p>
<h3>Map 2–Fresh Water Resources Per Capita</h3>
<p>(Image: The world is shown with the fresh water resources per captia labeled. In cubic meters per year, South America has between 10,000 or more. Southern Africa has 10,000 or more while the more north end of Africa is less than 1000. Australia and northern Asia has 10,000 or more, while southern Asia has 1700-3999. Most of Europe has 1700-3999. In North America, the United States and Mexico has 4000-9999, while Canada has 10,000 or more.</p>
<p>The image has a caption stating "Fresh water is an important resource to a country. People need fresh water to survive. They cannot drink ocean water because it contains salt. Growing crops and raising farm animals requires fresh water.  Fresh water is a renewable but limited resource. That means that humans could use it faster than it can renew itself if people are not careful. As you can see on this map, available fresh water varies around the world. "Per capita" means by each person, so to make this map, the amount of fresh water resources for a country was divided by its population.")</p>
<p>Which country of North America has the most available fresh water per capita?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><strong>Canada</strong></li>
<li>Greenland</li>
<li>Mexico</li>
<li>United States</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Canada has the greatest amount of fresh water per capita in North America. It has over 10,000 cubic meters available per person, per year. However, within each country, fresh water resources can vary by location. For example, Florida has a greater challenge with fresh water access than most other U.S. states.</p>
<h3>Map 3–Natural Forest Cover</h3>
<p>(Image: The world is shown with the percentage of total land area covered by natural forest labeled. South America has between 50.0% or more. Southern Africa has 50.0% or more while the more north end of Africa is less than 5.0%. Australia and southern Asia has15.0-29.9%, while northern Asia has 50.0% or more. Most of Europe has 30.0%-49.9%. In North America, Canada, the United States, and Mexico has 15.0-29.9%.</p>
<p>The image has a caption stating "Trees are an important natural resource. This map shows the portion of each county's land that has trees growing closely together. Trees provide clean air to breathe, nutrients for soil, and help protect water resources. Trees are very important to human building activities as well. Deforestation refers to land areas where humans and natural events consume trees but do not replace them. Greenland has no significant amount of forest area".)</p>
<p>For most of North America, what portion of the land does natural forest cover?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Less than 5%</li>
<li>5–14.9%</li>
<li><strong>15–29.9%</strong></li>
<li>More than 30%</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Most of North America has between 15 and 30% natural forest cover. Imagine a checkerboard with 100 squares, and between 15 and 30 of the squares are covered with trees. That is the portion of natural forest cover in North America.</p>
<h3>Map 4–Mineral Resources</h3>
<p>(Image: The world is shown with the type of mineral resources available labeled. In North America, Canada has Uranium, Silver, Oil, Iron, Coal, Copper, and Gold. The United States has Oil, Iron, Coal, Copper, and Gold. Mexico has Silver, Iron, and Copper.</p>
<p>The image has a caption stating "This map shows the location of significant mineral resources around the world, such as coal and silver. These minerals have value in trade and various economic activities. Coal and oil are nonrenewable resources critical for meeting fuel needs".)</p>
<p>Both Canada and the United States have multiple locations of this resource, but not Mexico. What resource is it?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Silver</li>
<li>Gold</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li><strong>Coal</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> The United States and Canada have multiple areas where coal is an available resource. Both countries and Mexico have silver and iron. Gold is only significant in Canada.</p>

<p>The countries in this table are the countries with the most crude oil reserves. Crude oil means the natural oil in the ground before humans process it into motor oil or other fuels. It is an extremely valuable resource because it is limited and humans use it in so many activities.</p>
<p>Which country of North America is not one of the top countries in the world with crude oil reserves?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><strong>Cuba</strong></li>
<li>Mexico</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia</li>
<li>United States</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Mexico and the United States are the only countries in North America with oil reserves among the top in the world. Saudi Arabia is in Southwest Asia, not North America. The best answer is Cuba, since it is in North America but not a top country for crude oil reserves.</p>
