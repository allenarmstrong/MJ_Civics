<h2>Self-Check Part One Text Version</h2>
<h3>Part One</h3>
<p>(Image of Jim in a skateboard shop.)</p>
<p>[Narrator] Hello! Meet Jim and Jan.</p>
<p>[Jim and Jan] Hi there!</p>
<p>[Narrator] Jim and Jan love the outdoors. They want to open their own surf and skate shop. They have a few questions.</p>	
<!--<p>(Images of skate and surf-related items and a computer cash register)</p> -->
<p>[Jim] We sure do. To get started, we need a place to set up our store and the products we will sell.</p>
<p>[Jan] Not only that, but we will clean and decorate the store. We will need a computer system to keep track of our sales and orders.</p>
<p>[Jim] Jan's right. We have some money saved, but it is only about half of what we need. Where can we find the rest of the money we need to open our store?</p>
<p>(Image of bank)</p>
<p>[Narrator] Starting a business is expensive. You could apply for a loan from a bank. Banks are an important part of making our economy work.</p>
<p>[Jan] But what do banks do? Will they just give us the money? Where does the money come from?</p>
<p>[Narrator] Whoaâ€”slow down Jan. I will address all your questions. First, I have one for you. The money you two have saved. Where is it?</p>
<p>[Jim] It's under my bed. Jan says a bank would be safer than keeping it at home, though, where it could be lost or stolen.</p>
<!--<p>(Person using an ATM)</p> -->
<p>[Narrator] Exactly! People deposit money into a bank to keep it safe. They trust the people who run the bank to take good care of their money, so it is available to them when they need it.</p>
<p>[Jan:]Why should we put our savings in a bank, other than to keep it safe?</p>
<!--<p>(Image of bank teller putting money in safe. Money multiplies over time.)</p> -->
<p>[Narrator] Banks can pay interest to savers based on the amount the savers deposited. Interest is the cost of borrowing money. When you deposit money in a bank, the bank uses that money elsewhere. It pays you interest because you allow the bank to borrow your money. You could grow your current savings while keeping it safe.</p>
<p>[Jim] Then we could take it out when we want to buy something, like skateboards, right?</p>
<!--<p>(Image of bank teller using money from safe.)</p> -->
<p>[Narrator] Yes, but not all of the money just sits in a vault. Banks use the deposits to make loans to other people and businesses.</p>
<p>[Jan] A bank could loan us the rest of the money we need!</p>
<p>[Narrator] That's right!</p>
<p>[Jan] A bank is a business too, though. How does it make profits if it just spreads money around?</p>
<!--<p>(Images from left to right: Pile of money that says "Loan", plus sign, smaller pile of money that says "Interest Fee", equals sign, largest pile of money that says "Total Cost of the Loan".)</p> -->
<p>[Narrator] Banks charge interest on the loans they make. This means that if a bank gives you a loan, you will eventually pay back more money than you borrowed. You learned earlier that you can earn interest by depositing money in the bank. Interest is also the cost you pay when you borrow money from a bank.</p>
<p>[Jim] Maybe we should keep saving until we have enough to open the shop ourselves.</p>
<p>[Narrator] That's certainly an option, Jim. You will spend less in the end. The advantage of a loan, though, is that you can reach your goals sooner. It helps the economy too. What if all people who wanted to open businesses waited until they had enough savings?</p>
<p>[Jim] We would see fewer new businesses, I suppose. Jan and I have been saving for years.</p> 
<!--<p>(Image of Jim and Jan sitting on a pile of money with a bank with people and money circling it.)</p> -->
<p>[Narrator] Right. Banks help the economy grow by moving money between savers and spenders. Savers hold on to their money. The money you have at home just lies there, though you are holding it for a good reason. Spenders buy products and the businesses that sell them earn profits that allow the businesses to grow. Banks send more money into circulation so more goods and services are bought and sold.</p>
<p>(Image of a few banks lined up, each advertising different interest rates: 8%, 7%, 6% and 5%.)</p>	
<p>[Jim] How much would the interest cost if we did get a loan?</p>
<p>[Narrator] It varies. Just like when you buy a new skateboard, you should shop around different banks to compare loans.</p>
<p>[Jan] We would want a loan with the lowest possible interest rate, right?</p>
<p>(Image of the lowest rate zoomed for emphasis.)</p>
<p>[Narrator] Correct. The lower the interest rate, the less you will have to pay for your loan. Banks advertise their interest rates. Their rates depend, in part, on what the Federal Reserve charges the banks for interest.</p>
<p>(Image of a large official building representing the Federal Reserve and 3 bank buildings appearing under it.)</p>
<p>[Jim] The banks borrow money, too? What is the Federal Reserve?</p>
<p>[Narrator] The Federal Reserve is the national bank of the United States. It oversees the practices of banks throughout the country. The Fed, as we call it, can loan money to banks so the banks can make more loans to people like you.</p> 
<p>[Jim] I bet the banks charge us more in interest than the Fed charges them.</p>
<p>[Narrator] Yes. Just as you will charge customers more for your surfboards than you will pay the supplier, banks will charge more for their product than they pay. That's how businesses make money.</p>
<p>[Jan] A bank's main product is loans. That makes sense. My parents have loans for our house and the car.</p>
