								<h1>How Does Government Protect Competition?</h1>
								<p>People in free market and mixed economies value competition. They believe it leads to inventions and ideas that make life better. Government helps protect the economy and competition through <span class="tooltip">laws<span><strong>Law:</strong> a rule established by government or other source of authority to regulate people's conduct or activities</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">regulations<span><strong>Regulation:</strong> an official rule or order that guides behavior related to laws, or to carry out a law</span></span>.</p>
								
								
								
								
								
								
								<div class="ui_tabs">
										<ul>
												<li><a href="#tabs-1">Antitrust</a></li>
												<li><a href="#tabs-2">Patent</a></li>
												<li><a href="#tabs-3">Price Controls</a></li>
										</ul>
										<div id="tabs-1">
												<p>The United States has <span class="tooltip">antitrust<span><strong>Antitrust:</strong> intending to prevent businesses from using practices that both prevent competition and lead to unfair profits</span></span> laws to prevent one business from being the only supplier of a good or service, or <span class="tooltip">monopoly<span><strong>Monopoly:</strong> a single business that controls the market for a good or service </span></span>. Regulations would prevent a business from making decisions that would close similar businesses.</p>
												<div class="indent">
														<p><strong>Antitrust laws encourage competition so people have choices and can get better prices.</strong></p>
														<div class="right img"><img src="images/05_03_06_a.jpg" alt="Video game store" /><br />

														<p>Imagine a big video game store lowers its prices so much that all the other video game stores lose their customers and must close down. If you wanted a game, you would have no choice but to buy from that one store. They could charge very high prices now that they are the only place to buy video games.  Maybe they will not release as many new games since they do not have to compete with other stores for customers. Since the store has no competition, it has no incentive to lower prices or make better games.</p>
														<br>
												</div>
										</div>
										<div id="tabs-2">
												<p>The United States also has <span class="tooltip">patent<span><strong>Patent:</strong> a document protecting the right of an inventor to make or sell an invention</span></span> laws. A patent protects people's inventions and <span class="tooltip">innovations<span><strong>Innovation:</strong> a new invention, improvement, or new way of doing something</span></span>. Regulations are rules for who can get a patent and how, and what specific rights the person has who holds the patent.</p>
												<div class="indent">
														<p><strong>Patent laws encourage competition by protecting ideas so people are motivated to create new things and try new ideas.</strong></p>
														<div class="right img"><img src="images/05_03_06_b.jpg" alt="Rocket skates" /><br />
																<span class="imgNote">&copy; 2011 AP Images</span></div>
														<p>Imagine your friend invents rocket-propelled wheeled shoesâ€”that are safe! She is selling them and happily earning profits. Then someone else makes the shoes, copying her design exactly, and selling them too! Your friend is upset. Someone else is selling the shoes, but she is receiving none of the profits even though they were her idea. Without protection for her design, your friend is not motivated to keep making the shoes or try to improve them.</p>
														<br>
												</div>
										</div>
										<div id="tabs-3">
												<p>Another type of regulation is <span class="tooltip">price controls<span><strong>Price Control:</strong> a maximum or minimum price set by law</span></span>. Government might set a minimum price or maximum price for a good or service if the market price is believed to be too low or too high. It prevents companies from forming a monopoly by lowering prices below the competition and taking all the customers. People do not agree whether price controls work. Price controls on U.S. airfare tickets were common before the 1980s. Price minimums are still common today on U.S. farm crops.</p>
												<div class="indent">
														<p><strong>Price controls encourage competition by preventing a monopoly and ensuring choices for buyers.</strong></p>

																<span class="imgNote">&copy; 2011 AP Images</span></div>
														<p>Imagine it is 1970 and you wish to visit Hawaii. You plan to fly there. You discover that three airlines fly there from your closest airport. At first, you thought you would just purchase the lowest-priced ticket. However, they all charge the same price for a ticket to Hawaii because of price controls.  Without choices in price to motivate you, you begin comparing the airline's time schedules, routes, seat sizes, and snacks offered. You may even choose to visit a location closer to your home to avoid purchasing a plane ticket.</p>
