<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Place the words in the appropriate place.</p>
<p>The <strong>U.S. Constitution</strong> protects the rights of people accused of crimes. It is based on the idea that people are <strong>innocent</strong> until proven <strong>guilty</strong> in a court of law. The <strong>Fifth Amendment</strong> protects a person from having to provide evidence against him or herself. The <strong>Sixth Amendment</strong> protects the right to a fair trial by jury. The <strong>Eighth Amendment</strong> protects people from cruel or unusual punishment and heavy bail or fines.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Supreme Court</strong> decisions have made specific changes to the ways these rights apply. Officers making an arrest must inform suspects of their rights because of <strong><em>Miranda v. Arizona</em></strong>. States must provide people an attorney who cannot afford one because of <strong><em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em></strong>. <strong>Juveniles</strong> have the same rights of due process as adults under the <strong>14th Amendment</strong> because of <strong><em>in re Gault</em></strong>.</p>
