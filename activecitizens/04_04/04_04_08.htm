<h1>Do Juveniles Have the Right of Due Process?</h1>
<p>In Arizona, police arrested and held a 15-year-old for several days. A neighbor accused Gerald Gault of making an offensive prank call. The neighbor never appeared for Gault's hearings before a judge.  He did not have an attorney at his hearings, either. The judge sentenced Gault to spend six years in a juvenile detention center. If Gault had been an adult, the maximum punishment would have been a small fine and two months in jail.</p>
<p>His family appealed the judge's ruling to higher courts. They insisted that the courts violated Gerald's rights. In 1967, the Supreme Court heard the appeal and agreed. The justices said he was not formally told the charges against him, informed of his rights, or assigned an attorney. He was not able to confront his accuser in court. The justices decided that Gault's sentence violated his rights protected in the Bill of Rights and his 14th Amendment right to due process. The official decision says "Neither the 14th Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults alone." They said the state of Arizona did not give him due process. As a result, the Constitutional rights of juvenile suspects are protected today, just as they are for legal adults.</p>
