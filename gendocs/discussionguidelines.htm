<ul>
  <li>Discussion Prompt:<br />
  What is your favorite pet?<br />&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sample Student Response:<br />
  My name is Shane, and my favorite pet is a cat because they are independent, you do not have to take them for a walk, and they take care of the mice. They are better than fish because they can play with you.<br />&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sample Agree Student Reply:<br />
  I agree with Shane. I would also like to add that cats are very playful. My cat likes to play with a ball of yarn and chase it around the house.<br />&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sample Disagree Student Reply:<br />
  I agree with part of your posting, Shane. I support you on having a favorite pet, but I feel differently about cats. Let me explain why dogs are better than cats. I agree that having a cat saves you time because you do not have to walk it, but I enjoy walking my dog. Walking a dog takes you outside, lets you enjoy the fresh air, and gets you some exercise.</li>
