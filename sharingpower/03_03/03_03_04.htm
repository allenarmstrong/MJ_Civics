<h1>What Is the Rule of Law?</h1>
<p>The <span class="tooltip">rule of law<span><strong>Rule of Law:</strong> the principle that both those who govern and those who are governed must obey the law and are subject to the same laws</span></span> is the principle that both those who govern and those who are governed must obey the law and are subject to the same laws. Everyone agrees to follow the laws. Following laws, like the laws of the road, helps protect people's safety and rights.</p>
<p>The rule of law means that we have both rights and responsibilities. For example, once you reach a certain age by law, you may obtain a driver's license. In using the license, you agree to follow the laws of the road. You have the <span class="tooltip">privilege<span><strong>Privilege:</strong> an advantage, right, or benefit that is not available to everyone</span></span> to use the license as long as you meet the responsibilities of having one, including obeying laws.</p>
<p>Each choice you make has consequences. For example, perhaps your community has a law that people riding bicycles must wear helmets. People who break this law could get hurt. They could receive a <span class="tooltip">ticket<span><strong>Ticket:</strong> in law, a notice that someone committed a traffic or parking offense and must pay a fine or appear in court</span></span> from <span class="tooltip">law enforcement<span><strong>Law Enforcement:</strong> agencies such as the FBI, police department, or sheriff's department that make sure people obey the law</span></span> for breaking the law.</p>

<div class="indent"><p>The consequences for breaking a law are more serious than those for breaking rules. For example, if you ride your bike before completing chores your parent requested, you might get in trouble with your parent. If you ride your bike without a helmet, you might get in trouble with law enforcement. </p></div>
