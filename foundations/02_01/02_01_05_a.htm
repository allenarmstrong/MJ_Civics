<h2>Founding Fathers Conversation Text Version</h2>
<p>[Instruction] Read as George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson talk over dinner. They will discuss how Enlightenment ideas influenced them. Take notes as you read.</p>
<p>[George Washington] Oh! You're here. Welcome, friend. We were just chatting about learning in our youth and what it means to us now. I did not have much schooling myself, but my friends John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did and attended universities.</p>
<p>[John Adams] That's right. Friend, I hear you are learning about how the Enlightenment influenced us when starting the new nation. We studied the writings of those men like Locke and Montesquieu, but that is not all.</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] No, in fact, we could not enter college without knowing Greek and Latin, the languages of the ancients! I assume our friends do know that ancient Greece and Rome are important to the Enlightenment and to our own ideas.</p>

<p>[George Washington] True. I could never translate the Romans' Latin or Greek myself, but I admire the classics. The Greeks gave us democracy, and the Romans gave us the republic. We see these ideas in our modern government. John, Thomas, could you tell our friends more about the Enlightenment philosophers?</p>
<p>[John Adams] Of course. Let's see, I think we have to start with Thomas Hobbes. He wrote about social contract theory.</p>

<p>[Thomas Jefferson] (exasperated) You would start with him, wouldn't you? What about John Locke?</p>
<p>[John Adams] Hang on, Thomas, we will get there. I just want to give Hobbes credit for the idea. See, Hobbes thought that without government people would work against each other, even hurt each other, to get what they need. So instead, they form a social contract. This means they agree to give a person or group of people the authority to make laws and enforce them. This way, people are safe to go about their lives without fear.</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] Yes, but in return, that government must not only protect people's lives, but their natural rights.</p>
<p>[George Washington] Is this where John Locke comes in?</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] Exactly, George. See, John Locke said that all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. Locke also wrote about the social contract. Just like Hobbes, he said it was an agreement between citizens and their government. People agree to follow the laws and support the government. In return, the government protects the people’s natural rights.</p>

<p>[George Washington] So, John Locke and Thomas Hobbes both believed in the social contract. Thomas, why do you think it is more important to focus on John Locke?</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] John Locke took the social contract a step further. He wrote that if government broke the contract, then the citizens could break away from that government and start a new one.</p>
<p>[John Adams] That's right. Moreover, just to clarify, Thomas means that if the government failed to protect people’s natural rights, that this was breaking the social contract.</p>
<p>[George Washington] Ah, I see. Thomas Hobbes first wrote about the social contract as an agreement between citizens and government. The people follow the government's rules so that they can go about their lives in peace.</p>
<p>John Locke wrote that natural rights are the people's rights to life, liberty, and property. John Locke said that government must protect these natural rights to keep the social contract. If the government failed, the people could start a new government.</p> 
<p>I understand. Friend, make sure you are taking notes. Include the meaning of these ideas. Remember, you can rewind the conversation before moving on.</p>
<p>[John Adams] Excuse me, they can do what?</p>
<p>[George Washington] Oh, it's just a neat thing people can do in the future to help them learn. Our friend told me about it earlier.</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] Wow–to think of all that time I spent copying down the texts in Greek.</p>
<p>[George Washington] (taskmaster) Gentlemen! Our friends are waiting to take notes. Could one of you tell us now about the Baron de Montesquieu?</p>

<p>[Thomas Jefferson] (excited) Oh, yes!</p>
<p>[John Adams] Of course, Thomas can. He loves everything French.</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] It's not because Montesquieu was French, John. See, the Baron gave us another very important idea. This idea was separation of powers.</p>

<p>[George Washington] Let's clarify for our friend. Does this relate to proper government and protecting people's rights? </p>
<p>[John Adams] Absolutely, George. Separation of powers means that you divide government into sections. Each section is responsible for one of the main tasks of government.</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] By dividing the tasks, the different sections of government have to work together to function properly. This helps protect people's natural rights because no one section of government makes all of the decisions. It prevents tyranny!</p>
<p>[George Washington] That makes sense. Let's tell our friends how Montesquieu divided the government tasks.</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] He said government should have three parts, or branches. The first is the legislative branch. This branch makes the laws. The Romans had a legislative branch. The name for the U.S. legislative branch is "Congress."</p>
<p>[George Washington] The second branch is the executive branch. This branch must enforce the laws. In our republic, many people work in this section. The president heads the executive branch. John, Thomas, and I were the first three U.S. presidents. Not in that order, though. (laughs)</p>
<p>[John Adams] (chuckles) I am sure Americans are still fond of you, George. The third branch is the judicial branch. This branch settles disputes and interprets the law. The court system makes up this branch. Judges and juries are part of the judicial branch. The U.S. Supreme Court is our highest court.</p>
<p>[George Washington] Our friend asks why the judicial branch is necessary. Shouldn’t the government know what it meant when it created a law in the first place? Why does it need a branch to interpret what they mean?</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] Let's use an example. Sometimes people disagree about how to use the law in a certain situation. For example, let's say your city has a 9 p.m. curfew for teens under 18. Working teens complain that this limits their work hours at those "quickie eat" places. What if teens were arrested under this law after leaving work late and they thought it was unfair?</p>
<p>[George Washington] I think you mean "fast food" restaurants, Thomas. You would love the french fries. That is a good example, though. The arrested person could bring the case to court and challenge the law. A judge would interpret the law. The judge could decide whether the city should allow exceptions to the law, such as for work or school functions.</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] Thank you, George. Yes, Montesquieu was very influential on us in forming the U.S. government. The U.S. Constitution divides the nation’s government into three branches. I am sure our friend is wondering, though, how we make sure the branches stick to their assigned duties.</p>
<p>[John Adams] That brings us back to the idea of the social contract. The government only exists because the citizens agree to it and expect it to protect their rights. John Locke was so important, as you would know, Thomas.</p>
<p>[Thomas Jefferson] Absolutely, the social contract and natural rights ideas are still important to the United States today.</p>
<p>[John Adams] Yes, I believe in our friend's time U.S. leaders must remember their responsibility to the citizens. Those who do not will lose support from the voters!</p>
<p>[George Washington] I agree. You can see the influence of the Enlightenment on our thinking even in the way the United States operates in our friend's time.</p>
