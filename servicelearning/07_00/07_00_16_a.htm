<h2>Discussion Posting Guidelines</h2>
<h3>Sample AGREE Starters</h3>
<p>When you support or agree with what someone is saying, you may want to use these response starters: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>I agree with      _____. I think his/her strongest point was ____ because … </li>
  <li>I agree with      _____. I would also like to add … </li>
  <li>_____ makes an      excellent point. I also believe … </li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample DISAGREE Starters</strong></h3>
<p>When you disagree with what someone is saying, it is very important that you remember online etiquette. You can disagree in a polite way, without hurting others’ feelings. Consider using one of these response starters: </p>
<ul>
  <li>____ makes an      excellent point when he/she stated _____. However, I disagree with _______      because …</li>
  <li>I agree with part      of your posting. I support you on ____, but I feel differently about      _____. Let me explain why … </li>
</ul>
<p>Example Post and Replies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discussion Prompt:<br />
    Describe your service project plan.<br />&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Sample Student Response:<br />
     My name is Ashleigh. I have a chronic disease and stay home most of the time. Many kids like me benefit from online courses. I want to help us by starting an online discussion group. We can talk about how to be successful in classes. We can support each other in the day-to-day stresses of being ill.<br />&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sample Agree Student Reply:<br />
   I agree that the group is a good idea, Ashleigh. I would like to add that perhaps your group could create a website for the public. It would let people know about your struggles, as well as how online learning helps you. I don’t think many kids know much about chronic illnesses.<br />&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sample Disagree Student Reply:<br />
    I agree with part of your idea, Ashleigh. I like that you want to support other students like yourself. However, you might want to see if another organization has a support section for students. There might be one for your specific illness. Maybe they will start a discussion group for you with your input. This way you can lead it but without the responsibility of moderating it every day.
