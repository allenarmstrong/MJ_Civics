<h1>Is Federalism the Only Way to Share Power?</h1>
<p>The U.S. government is based on <span class="tooltip">federalism<span><strong>Federalism:</strong> division of powers among local, state, and national governments</span></span>. Under the Constitution, the 50 states share power with the federal government. The states must follow federal laws. We call it a federation. However, this is not the only way to organize a country's political divisions. Study the different ways in this activity.</p>

              <h2>Arrangement of Government</h2>
              <p>Governments also differ in how they manage their political divisions, such as state or local governments. Some of the arrangements are:</p>
              <ul>
              		<li>Unitary</li>
					<li>Confederation</li>
					<li>Federation</li>

              <p>A <b>unitary</b> government makes all major decisions for the whole nation. Smaller units of government, like states or cities, have limited powers and functions. The central government chooses what powers and functions to give them. Most nations of Europe and Africa have unitary governments.</p>
		    <p class="italic">
		    Each color on the map shows five different states. For each state you will see that the state capitals image is smaller than the central government image. This is because in a Unitary goverment the state or cities have limited powers and funcitons compared to the central governement.

              <p>A <b>confederation</b> is a group of loosely allied states. The central government of the nation is weak. It only has the powers that the individual states agree to give to it. Usually a group of states forms a confederation to meet a specific need, such as for defense or to create a common currency.</p>
		    <p class="italic">
		    Each color on the map shows five different states. For each state you will see that the state capitals image is larger than the central government image. This is because in a Confederation the central government of the nation is weaker than the state governments.

              <p>A <b>federation</b> is a group of allied states with a powerful central government. The states and central government share powers and functions. The central government cannot take away the states' power to make their own laws. However, it can make laws that affect how each state governs its people.</p>
		    <p class="italic">
		    Each color on the map shows five different states. For each state you will see that the central government image is just a slight bit bigger than the state government image. This is because in a Federation there is a powerful central government that shares powers and functions with the state governments.

              <p>A <b>parliamentary</b> government has a <strong>legislative branch</strong> with authority over the <strong>executive branch</strong>. Elected members of the legislature choose the executive leader or leaders. Often this leader's title is "prime minister." The prime minister is a member of the legislative branch and answers to that group. He or she is responsible for carrying out decisions of the legislative branch. The <strong>prime minister</strong> is similar to a president. However, a president is elected by the people. A president answers to the voters, not the legislative branch.</p>
