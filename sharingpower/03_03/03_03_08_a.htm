<h2>What are the types of law?  Text Version</h2>

<p><strong>Mr. Tim Warner:</strong> What are the types of law?  We're all probably familiar with criminal law, maybe you've seen on TV, court TV or something like that, maybe a murder case or a robbery case. That's criminal law, but there's also civil law. Civil law deals with property disputes or divorce cases, child custody issues, it involves with contract issues, when someone's injured in a car accident the law that would apply there is typically going to be a civil case where someone seeks monetary damage.  The difference between a civil law and criminal law is in criminal law usually the sanction imposed by the court could include imprisonment, where with civil law we're talking about the award of money typically.</p>
