<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>Answer the following questions in your own words.</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is public policy? Why is citizen action important in public policy?<br /><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
  <li>What issues in your community (local or state) interest you? (Suggestions <strong>include</strong> environmental issues, land-use issues, transportation issues, and education.)<br /><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
  <li>Choose one of the issues from the above question to use for research in Part 2. Which do you think is most important to the community? Make sure that your issue is a state or local issue that involves public policy. Ask your instructor or a trusted adult if you are unsure whether your issue will work for this activity.<br /><p>&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol>
