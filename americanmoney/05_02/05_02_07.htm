<h1>How Do Businesses Shape Society?</h1>
<p>As businesses grow and thrive, they can become important parts of our everyday lives. You may have a favorite place for French fries or having fun. Perhaps you are loyal to a brand of shoes. The goods and services we use are part of American culture. Growth makes a business familiar to more and more people, to the point where you can name a business and no one asks what you mean. For example, people around the world as well as Americans know what McDonald's<sup>&reg;</sup> is and what is sold there.</p>
<p>In this way, business growth encourages cultural diffusion. People share the common experience of certain goods and services. As a business grows and opens locations in new places, that shared experience spreads to more people. Examine this map to see how business growth turned Ben and Jerry's<sup>&reg;</sup> from a hit in Vermont to a national favorite.</p>

            <h2>1978-The First Ben and Jerry's<sup>&reg;</sup></h2> 
            <p>Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield took a course on ice-cream making. They decided to open their own ice cream shop to earn a living. Since, they figured, young people love ice cream, they chose a place that had a college to open their first shop—Burlington, Vermont.</p>

The foundation continues to support efforts to improve the common good.</p>

<p>It's important to note that cultural diffusion is not limited to businesses and their products.  Aspects of culture such as language, religion, even political movements can and do spread as people and ideas and people move and connect.  Technology like television and the Internet make cultural diffusion in today's world more rapid than ever!</p>
