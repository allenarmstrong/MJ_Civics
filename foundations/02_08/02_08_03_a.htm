<h2>Amending the Constitution Text Version</h2>
<p>This living document has grown in its ability to adopt further expressions of justice. Some of this growth came through bloodshed and led to abolition of slavery. Other 
changes were through more peaceful dissent, such as gaining the vote for women. The flexibility of the Constitution is one of its strengths that many praised in 
Philadelphia at the celebrations.</p>
 <p>In 1865, slavery was abolished by the authority of the 13th Amendment. The right to equal protection under the law was guaranteed by the 14th Amendment in 1868. 
The right of black men to vote was guaranteed by the 15th Amendment in 1870. But it would take women, half the population of America for 200 years, until 1920 to gain
their right to vote under the authority of the 19th Amendment. And in 1971, the right to vote was extended to 18-year-olds, the 26th Amendment, but surely not the last.</p>
