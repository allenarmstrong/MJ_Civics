<h1>Why are the Civil War Amendments Important?</h1>
<p>Though slavery was now against federal law, not all states gave former slaves legal <span class="tooltip">citizenship<span><strong>Citizenship:</strong> legal status of being a citizen, or a person's actions and behavior as a citizen</span></span>. The 14th Amendment defined former slaves as citizens. It also contains the <span class="tooltip">Equal Protection Clause<span><strong>Equal Protection Clause:</strong> part of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution saying that no state should deny any citizen equal rights and protections under the law</span></span>. This statement says that every citizen has the same rights under the law. It is meant to prevent state governments from applying the laws in different ways for different groups of citizens.</p>
<p>The 13th and 14th amendments were critical for former slaves after the Civil War. Without them, owning a business, voting, marriage, and other rights would not have not been possible for many former slaves. The amendments also made the last of the Civil War amendments possible. The 15th Amendment protects the right of <span class="tooltip">citizens<span><strong>Citizen:</strong> a person who is native or naturalized to a country</span></span> to vote no matter their race or skin color.</p>
