<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Many issues that Americans face are not unique to the United States. People around the globe discuss many of the same problems. Issues like pollution and disease do not stop at country borders. We call issues that are shared worldwide "global issues."</p>
<p>Imagine you and your team have been traveling the world. Upon your return, reporters ask you to discuss what you think is the most important global issue facing the world today. In this activity, you will create a presentation to share with Americans about an important global issue. Use the <strong>Collaboration Assessment Guide</strong> to form your team and start this activity.</p>

<h3>Step One: Identify a Global Issue</h3>

<p>What issues concern you and your team members? About what issue would you like to learn more? You can pick up or download almost any newspaper and see information about current issues affecting people worldwide. Scan the news, TV, and talk with trusted adults to help you identify global issues. Discuss with your team and agree to focus on one issue. Note that these issues are <strong>interdependent</strong>. While you focus on one, you will see that it has ties to many other issues. Suggested issues include:</p>
<ul>
 
  <li>Poverty and hunger</li>			
  <li>Deforestation</li>
  <li>Globalization</li>
  <li>Child workers</li>
  <li>Refugees</li>
  <li>Human rights</li>
  <li>AIDS</li>
  <li>Free trade</li>
  <li>Energy</li>
  <li>Clean water</li>
  <li>Terrorism</li>
</ul> 

<p>You may use the discussion area or a Web 2.0 tool to organize your team's work. Be sure you have parent and instructor permission before using websites or communicating outside the course. The first section of the <strong>Collaboration Assessment Guide</strong> will help you organize your team.</p> 
 
 <h3>Step Two: Conduct Background Research</h3>
 
 <p>Once your team agrees on an issue, each member must research its background. You should find information that answers the following questions:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>What is the issue?</li>
   <li>Where is it happening?</li>
   <li>Whom is it affecting? How many people are affected? </li>
   <li>When is it happening? How long has it been an issue?</li>
   <li>How does it affect people, governments, and the environment?</li>
   <li>Why is it happening?</li>
   <li>What are people currently doing to help? Where are they helping?</li>
   <li>Why should Americans care about the issue?</li>
   <li>Do other countries around the world agree that it is a major issue?</li>
   <li>What more do you think could people do to help?</li>
 </ul>
<h3>Step Three: Discuss the Global Issue</h3>

<p>As a team, share and discuss the information you found about your global issue. Make sure you have plenty of details for all of the research questions. Add in your own ideas for ways people can do more to help. You may use this<strong> Global Issue Research Chart</strong> to help collect your information.</p>
<h3>Step Four: Create Global Issue Presentation</h3>

<p>Create a presentation that explains the global issue. Be sure to include this information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>explanation of the issue</li>
  <li>explanation of answers to the research questions in the Global Issue Team Chart</li>
  <li>what people are currently doing to assist and where</li>
  <li>why Americans should care about the issue</li>
  <li>what people can do to help</li>
</ul>
<p>Your team can choose your format. Imagine your team will present it to reporters and government officials. Example formats include slideshow, video, or brochure. Be creative, and include pictures that help people understand the issue.</p>
<h3>Step Five: Submit to Instructor</h3>

<p>There are <strong>two parts</strong> to your work in the collaboration activity. View the Grading Rubrics before completing and submitting this activity.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1</strong>&mdash;Once your team's discussion, brainstorming, and citizen group presentation are complete, you are ready to submit your Collaboration Project to assessment <strong>S2 00 Collaboration Project Segment Two</strong>. Be sure to include</p>
