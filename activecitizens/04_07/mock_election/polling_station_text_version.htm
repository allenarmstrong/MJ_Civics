<p><em><strong>Several hours laterâ€¦</strong></em></p>
<p>Relaxing at home after Election Day, you find out who won the election. Select the winner of the election to see how he or she will affect the future of Concord City: </p>
<ul>
  <li>David Democrat</li>
  <li>Elaine Environs</li>
  <li>Norman No-Tax</li>
  <li>Rita Republican</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you chose Rita Republican</strong><em>: </em></p>
<p>After winning re-election to her second term, Rita Republican sets up meetings with the Amazing Grapes company. Within a few months, they break ground to build a new factory in Concord City. Jobs are created delivering grapes to and processing them at the factory. More people move into the area. Many farmers are concerned that they earn less for their grapes than when they sold grapes and grape products on their own, but others are grateful to have the factory as a steady customer. Meetings begin between farmers and city officials to explore the cost of irrigation with city water.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you chose Norman No-Tax</strong>: </em></p>
<p>After winning election to his first term as mayor of Concord City, Norman No-Tax immediately begins studying the city&rsquo;s budget in detail. He finds places where the city can cut costs to lower the tax burden on the city&rsquo;s residents. Some of his ideas are very controversial, such as reducing funding for after-school programs. He sets up a series of weekly meetings, open to all residents, to discuss the suggested cuts. Progress is slow as residents have many different priorities. Yet he sticks to his plan, and eventually they approve several cuts, lowering taxes slightly for all residents. Farmers expected more, and many of Norman&rsquo;s neighbors are disappointed. However, meetings begin between farmers and city officials to explore the cost of irrigation with city water.</p>
<p><strong>If you chose Elaine Environs: </strong></p>
<p>After winning election to her first term as mayor of Concord City, Elaine Environs calls a meeting of the city&rsquo;s farmers and scientists to discuss ways to improve farming methods, including expanding irrigation. Older farmers like Norman No-Tax are resistant to try new methods without the city paying for it and providing training. Elaine proposes a slight tax increase on sales of grape products to help pay for the new methods, training, and experimental farm on the unused land. Residents who are not farmers are upset because they also end up paying the tax without gaining any benefit. Elaine tries to assure them that they do benefit because many of their jobs depend indirectly on a successful grape crop.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you chose David Democrat:</strong></em></p>
<p>After winning election to his first term as mayor of Concord City, David Democrat hires an architect to make plans for a new agricultural and technical high school. He suggests a tax increase to pay for the new school. Many parents are grateful for a new opportunity for their children. However, many farmers resist, saying the best way to learn the grape business is by spending time on the farms, not more time in the classroom. They want immediate help with the problems of drought and failing grape crops, so David suggests another tax increase to help expand irrigation to farms. He begins holding a series of meetings to explain how the tax increases for the school and farms would be temporary but lead to benefits for the city for a long time. Five months after the election, the city is still debating the tax increases.</p>
