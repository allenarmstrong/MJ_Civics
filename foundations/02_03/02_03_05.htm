<h1>What Is in the Declaration of Independence?</h1>
<p>The Declaration of Independence has three main sections. The colonists began by describing their beliefs about government, including <span class="tooltip">natural rights<span><strong>Natural Rights:</strong> rights that people are born with and that no government can take away</span></span> and the <span class="tooltip">social contract<span><strong>Social Contract:</strong> the idea that people agree, or consent, to government authority and in return the government protects the people and their rights</span></span>. The middle section is the list of <span class="tooltip">grievances<span><strong>Grievance:</strong> reason or cause for complaint</span></span> against King George III. The document ends with the official statement of independence. Examine this chart to learn more details.</p>

<p>Did you know that the original Declaration of Independence was hand printed on parchment? Parchment is animal skin that is specially treated for use as paper. Parchment lasts longer than regular paper, and people saved it for very important documents. You can see an image of the original Declaration of Independence and a <span class="tooltip">transcript<span><strong>Transcript:</strong> a written record</span></span> in your <a class="pop" href="02_03_02_a.htm" title="CAP file" data-height="750">CAP File</a>.</p><br />
