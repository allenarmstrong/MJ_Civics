<h2>Map Text Version</h2>
<p>A map showing the support for the Constitution by areas within each state. Note that the borders of the states were not all the same as today. Think about New York. Is it possible for a state that appears mostly against the Constitution to ratify it? Some states have more population living in an area, so more votes came from there.</p>
