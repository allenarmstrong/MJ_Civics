<p>Slide 1: [Image of Mark Wandall] <br />
Each year hundreds are killed and more than 100,000 are injured nationwide in car crashes caused by drivers who run red lights. The Mark Wandall Foundation was created after Mark Wandall lost his life when another driver ran a red light.
</p>
<p>Slide 2: [Image of Melissa and Madisyn Grace Wandall] <br />
 Mark's wife Melissa, who was 9 months pregnant, decided the night of the crash that she would find a way to make something positive of the tragedy. She was determined to make a positive impact on her community and beyond by educating others about the consequences of reckless driving on our highways.

<p>Slide 3: [Image of Madisyn Grace and Florida Governor Charlie Crist]  <br />
Mark's daughter, Madisyn Grace, works alongside her mother to champion the cause of safer highways.  Here, Madisyn sits with former Florida Governor Charlie Crist as he signs the Mark Wandall Traffic Safety Act into law.  Madisyn and her mother worked with the Florida legislature to pass this bill, which provides law enforcement additional resources to help combat red-light running.

<p>Slide 4: [Images of Mark, Melissa and Madisyn Grace Wandall]  <br />
In addition to working with government to improve highway safety, The Mark Wandall Foundation has a division called "Safety Saves Lives." This program honors Mark's daughter Madisyn, reaching out to children whose parents have been killed in vehicle related collisions.

<p>Slide 5: [Image of Madisyn at fundraising event]  <br />
Madisyn and her mother work together to provide aid through fundraising efforts so that these children are able to receive counseling, college scholarships and attend camps for children dealing with loss of a loved one.

Through Madisyn and her mother's tireless efforts and the generosity of others, the Mark Wandall foundation has successfully worked to move money from those willing to give; to help support and nurture the children who have experienced loss in their lives.
