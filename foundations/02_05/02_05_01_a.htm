<h2>Siblings Arguing Text Version</h2>
<p>Dad hands three siblings a chore list. Dad says, "These chores need to be done. It's up to you three to decide how to split up the responsibility."</p>
<p>Youngest says, "I'm the baby. I shouldn't have to do anything."</p>
<p>Middle child says, "No way! Dad handed it to you, too. You are big enough to handle walking the dog and dusting."</p>
<p>Older child says, "That will work. So then, you (pointing to middle child) can take cleaning the bathroom and vacuuming. I will sweep and mop the floors. Then I will â€¦ "</p>
<p>Middle child says "Hey! Why do you get the easy job? Just because you are oldest doesn't mean you get to tell everybody what to do."</p>
<p>Older child says (and is a bit angry), "I wasn't done yet. I will also take cleaning out the hall closet and laundry. Those will take forever."</p>
<p>Youngest says, "Will you go with me to walk the dog?" (to middle child, who looks exasperated)</p>
<p>Middle child: "OK, I'll go with you. We can check the mail when we come back in."</p>
<p>Older child says, "Great! We have everything covered. I just need you (to middle child) to do the bathroom soon so I can clean the floor in there."</p>
<p>Middle child: "Yuck! Now you're going to tell me when to do each job!?"</p>
<p>Youngest says, "We'll be done faster if we work together!" (middle child still annoyed, oldest child smiling at the youngest)</p>
