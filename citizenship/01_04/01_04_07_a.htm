<h2>Ecology Citizenship Text Version</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello! This is Ella Erosion and Manny Mangrove. Here at <em>Eco-News</em> we work hard to bring you   news on issues of ecology. Our mission is to bring people together to help make our environment better. Help from citizens is so important to the   success of our mission. Thank you for tuning in!</p>
<p>In Florida, the Tampa Bay area faces many ecological issues. Oyster beds and mangroves are important to preventing beach erosion and filtering the water. Yet these resources are threatened. Many people move into the Tampa Bay area each year. The following list includes some of the effects of this growth:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Construction has destroyed large portions of the mangrove forest.</li>
    <li>Wastewater from sewage pipes pollutes the bay water.</li>
    <li>Illegal oyster harvesting has decreased the oyster population.</li>
  </ul>
<p>We want to protect the ecology of the area and still welcome new people. We need your help!</p>
<p>You will be a key player in helping protect Tampa Bay. You have many choices to make. Let's get started!</p>
<h3>Scenario 1</h3>
<p>The state of Florida is giving you $1 billion to address Tampa Bay's ecological issues. Local fisheries complain that the biggest issue is the oysters. Restaurants do not have enough to serve their customers. The government issues licenses to certain companies to harvest the oysters. This protects the oyster population. However, many people harvest them without a license, meaning too many oysters are taken from the bay.</p>
<p>What will you do first to help Tampa Bay?</p>
<h4>A</h4>
<p>Use some of the grant money for lawyers. Seek arrests of people who harvest oysters without a license.<br />
<a href="#2A">Go to 2A</a></p>
<h4>B</h4>
<p>Ask volunteers for help restoring oyster beds. Use some of the grant money to build special domes for the oysters.<br />
<a href="#2B">Go to 2B</a></p>
<h3 id="2A">Scenario 2A</h3>
<p>Police report difficulty catching illegal harvesters. People speed away on their boats, creating waves that smack the shore and oyster beds. The oyster population begins to grow because illegal harvesters are chased away. However, the beach erosion continues. Scientists say part of the problem is dying mangroves.</p>
<p>What will you do next?</p>
<h4>A</h4>
<p>Use grant money to eliminate invasive species of plants. Ask volunteers to help find and destroy them. These plants spread quickly. They choke and destroy the native mangroves.<br />
<a href="#3AA">Go to 3AA</a></p>
<h4>B</h4>
<p>Use grant money to purchase large mangrove forests. Refuse all requests to build on the land. Leave the mangroves to their natural state.<br />
<a href="#3B">Go to 3B</a></p>
<h3 id="2B">Scenario 2B</h3>
<p>The domes protect the oysters, and their population grows. Yet the new beds are not enough to stop the beach erosion. Scientists say part of the problem is dying mangroves.</p>
<p>What will you do next?</p>
<h4>A</h4>
<p>Use grant money to eliminate invasive species of plants. Ask volunteers to help find and destroy them. These plants spread quickly. They choke and destroy the native mangroves.<br />
<a href="#3BA">Go to 3BA</a></p>
<h4>B</h4>
<p>Use grant money to purchase large mangrove forests. Refuse all requests to build on the land. Leave the mangroves to their natural state.<br />
<a href="#3BB">Go to 3BB</a></p>
<h3 id="3AA">Scenario 3AA</h3>
<p>The mangrove restoration efforts are successful. However, the water in the bay is polluted. Some mangroves die, and people do not want to eat the bay oysters. Some drainage pipes from the city lead into the bay. People are dumping chemicals into the drainage system. Water pollution drives the manatees and other marine mammals to find clean water, putting them in danger from boats. The government money is nearly gone.</p>
<p>What will you do next?</p>
<h4>A</h4>
<p>Use grant money to build water treatment plants for the drainage water. This will remove chemicals from the water before they can reach and pollute the bay. Require boaters to take special precautions to prevent manatee injury.<br />
<a href="#4A">Go to 4A</a></p>
<h4>B</h4>
<p>Use grant money to educate people about the gentle manatees. Post signs near drains warning people not to dump chemicals there. Continue efforts to increase oyster growth because they filter the bay water.<br />
<a href="#4B">Go to 4B</a></p>
<h3 id="3AB">Scenario 3AB</h3>
<p>You protected many mangrove forests but are nearly out of grant money. Many people are angry that so much area is not available for building. Some are ignoring the laws related to protection of these lands. People dump wastewater into drains that lead to the bay, polluting the water. Water pollution drives the manatees to find clean water, putting them in danger from boats.</p>
