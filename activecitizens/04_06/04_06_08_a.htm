<h2>President Nixon Resigns from Office Text Version</h2>
<p>[Narrator] At 12:20 this afternoon presidential news secretary Ronald Ziegler stepped before microphones and an overflowed crowd of reporters in the White House briefing room.</p>
<p>[Ronald Ziegler] I am aware of the intense interests of the American people and of you in this room, concerning developments today and over the last few days. This has of course has been a difficult time. The President of the United States will meet various members of the bipartisan leadership of congress here at the White House early this evening. Tonight at 9:00 eastern daylight time, the President of the United States will address the nation on radio and television from his Oval Office.</p>

<p>[President Nixon] I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad.</p>
<p>To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home.</p>
<p>Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as president at hour in this office.</p>
