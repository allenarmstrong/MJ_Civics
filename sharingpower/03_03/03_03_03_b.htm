<h2>Teens and Consequences Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Jim Bergenn [Attorney, Shipman &amp; Goodwin]</strong>&nbsp; Teenagers are mid-way of course between kids and adults. And with kids, we decide as a society that they are still forming. And as adults, we hold everybody fully responsible for their conduct. Teenagers are in between, and we want them to take responsibility, but we also recognize that sometimes they falter and they can't handle the responsibility quite yet. So we give them more responsibility and more consequences than for kids, but we usually give them a second chance, more than we would for adults, hoping they are learning from the experience.</p>
<p>Even though we give teenagers more latitude in some areas, in other areas we don't. And that is in areas where they can actually affect other people. And so when they pose a risk on other people, for example driving, we are more controlled over teenagers. We want to make sure they are not driving on highways, or at night, or that they are ever having anything to drink. And we might even charge a lot more for their insurance because of the proven fact that they are more risk prone and they don't quite understand typically the risks that they're dealing with.</p>
<p>Another area where we don't give them the same rights is voting. And that's more because they don't yet have a stake; they don't own their own property, they don't own their own homes, they don't have jobs that support themselves. So while we care about what they have to say, and they can get involved in political campaigns, the actual vote is reserved for those over eighteen and are at risk. For example, going to the army, or going to war, or having to pay taxes, all these things don't really affect the younger teens.</p>
