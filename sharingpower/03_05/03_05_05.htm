<h1>How Do You Learn About Laws?</h1>

<p>If there were a new curfew law, how would you know? You can learn about new legislation in many ways. At the federal level, both houses of Congress have web sites where you can search both current, proposed bills, those that have passed, and bills from the past. State-level governments have web sites as well where you can search for this information. Many local governments have web sites.</p>

<p><a class="pop" href="http://www.house.gov" title="House.gov will open in a new window">U.S. House of Representatives at house.gov</a></p>

<div class="right img"><img src="images/03_05_05_media.jpg" alt="Image of various electronics that you can use to get news about legislation." /></div> 
<p>In these web sites, you will find links to legislation information. You can search by keyword. For example, if you are interested in bills related to schools, you could enter &quot;education&quot; into a keyword search box. You may also search by recent activity.</p>


<p>For local issues, examine your local newspapers in print and, if available, online. At the local level, laws are usually called codes or ordinances. Public television channels often broadcast city or county council, school board, and other local government meetings. You can view a meeting or even attend one with an adult. Attending a local government meeting in person is much more exciting than viewing or reading about one! This is a great way to learn more about local lawmaking and the part citizens play in the process.</p>
<p>The news also can be a great source of information about laws. Controversial laws or proposed bills especially attract a lot of media attention. Through newspapers, news web sites, television, and radio, you can hear different people's views about the laws.</p>
