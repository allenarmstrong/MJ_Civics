This protects the U.S. economy by ensuring farms stay in operation and enough crops are grown to meet demand.');

<h1>How Do These Ideas Affect the United States?</h1>
<p>Scarcity, choice, supply and demand, and opportunity cost are the driving forces that shape the U.S. economy. When people are free to make choices, such as starting a business, we call this a <span class="tooltip">market economy<span><strong>Market Economy:</strong> an economic system that relies upon supply and demand to distribute resources and determine prices</span></span>. As individuals, they consider the effects of prices and opportunity cost.</p>
<p>The United States has a <span class="tooltip">mixed market economy<span><strong>Mixed Market:</strong> an economy with individual economic freedom mixed with some government economic planning and regulation</span></span>. This means that it is a market economy, but the government also makes some decisions that affect the choices people can make. For example, U.S. law says that a business must pay employees a minimum amount per hour of work. This government decision protects workers but limits the business owner's choice in what to pay employees. In a mixed market economy, the government makes some decisions to protect the people from the negative effects of supply and demand.</p>
<p>In this chart, view examples of how each idea affects the mixed market economy of the United States.</p>
