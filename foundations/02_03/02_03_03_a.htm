<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The day is June 7, 1776. What follows is an imagined version of the discussion that may have taken place in the Continental Congress that day.</p>
<h3>Conversation</h3>
<p>[Voice 1] Good morning, gentlemen. Let us consider a resolution from Mr. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia. Mr. Thomas Jefferson of Virginia has agreed to take notes.</p>
<p>[Richard H. Lee] Thank you. Gentlemen, the people of Virginia have decided the time has come to break our ties to Britain. As Mr. Thomas Paine said in his now-famous pamphlet, it is simply "common sense." As a delegate from Virginia, I propose that we unite as colonies and declare our independence from Britain.</p>
<p>[Voice 2] Will the people in all of our colonies support us? Not everyone has read Common Sense, and many are far from the fighting that has broken out in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>[Voice 3] Let's examine the facts and then share them with the people in our separate colonies. Since the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, Britain has treated us unfairly.</p>
<p>[Voice 1] That is when Britain began taxing us. Never before did we, as colonists, pay such high taxes to Britain!</p>
<p>[Voice 4] Mr. Jefferson, write that down!</p>
<p>[Voice 2] Britain needed a lot of money to pay for the war, and it did help protect our colonies from the French and Native Americans. King George III said we all had to help pay.</p>
<p>[Voice 3] However, the king did not ask for our consent! If we are to be taxed as British citizens, we deserve representation in the British government! We deserve to have our concerns heard in Britain!</p>
<p>[Voice 4] Write that down!</p>
<p>[Voice 1] In 1773, the Boston Tea Party was a protest against the tax on tea. Britain responded with the awful laws we call the Intolerable Acts!</p>
<p>[Voice 2] Let's not forget, though, that in the king's mind, the people of Massachusetts destroyed British property, meaning the tea. He had to do something.</p>
<p>[Voice 3] We agreed that these acts were much too harsh! The closing of Boston Harbor made life for people in Massachusetts very difficult. Remember, what the king does to one colony, he could do just as easily to any of our colonies!</p>
<p>[Voice 1] The Intolerable Acts also force us to shelter British soldiers in our homes and barns. The soldiers should have returned to Britain years ago, and I think the trouble near Boston has been worse because they have been here.</p>
<p>[Voice 4] Write that down!</p>
<p>[Voice 3] Yes, the king must see us now as the threat, because we are willing to fight back against his policies! If he is worried about future acts of protest, it would make sense that he has kept soldiers here. That must also be why any British officials arrested here in the colonies must go on trial in Britain, far from where we can build a case against them!</p>
<p>[Voice 4] Write that down, too!</p>
<p>[Voice 2] The king must be reasonable. Let us send another letter of complaint before taking such a worrisome measure as declaring independence.</p>
<p>[Voice 1] We have tried petitions, though. Two years ago, many people now in this room helped create the petition sent after the Intolerable Acts passed. We refused to buy or use British goods until Britain removed those punishing laws. We said we would meet again the next year if the king and Parliament did nothing. Therefore, we did. Last year, fighting broke out between Massachusetts colonists and British soldiers. Colonists died at these battles in Lexington and Concord. We sent the "Olive Branch Petition" asking the king to stop his soldiers from making war on us. We only wanted peace and to let the king know we were still loyal to Britain.</p>
<p>[Voice 3] And how did the king respond? He ignored us both times! He believes we have no right to make any requests of him or Parliament! He does not respect us as citizens nor does he respect the loyalty we have given for so long.</p> 
<p>[Voice 4] Write that down!</p>
<p>[Voice 2] If we declare independence, Britain will make war on us! Can we possibly survive that? Who will we trade with to get the goods we need to live?</p>
<p>[Voice 1] The fighting already began in Massachusetts two months ago. Thomas Paine's pamphlet, published earlier this year, is helping to convince people in many colonies that we need to break away. He points out that we would be able to make trade agreements with the countries of Europe on our own. The king has had too much control over our trade.</p>
<p>[Voice 3] Yes, how can we not consider independence at this point? We are strong enough without Britain. Besides that, what kind of government attacks its own people?</p>
<p>[Voice 4] Write that down!</p>
<p>[All Voices Cheering] Hear, hear! Hear, hear!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The delegates had to work with leaders in their colonies to convince more people to support independence. They appointed five delegates to create a document that would list the grievances, or complaints, against the king. John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Robert Livingston, and Roger Sherman were part of this group. They presented their work at the end of June. On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress approved the Declaration of Independence.</p>
