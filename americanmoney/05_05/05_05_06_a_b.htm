<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Every day, evidence of government in action is all around us. For example, local governments build the streetlights that turn on at dusk. They build and monitor the water treatment plants that provide safe drinking water. Tax dollars at work show up everywhere.</p>
<p>Imagine you and your partners are part of a "watchdog" team. A "watchdog" is a person or group guarding against illegal, wasteful, or unacceptable practices. People in your communities want proof that the local taxes they pay truly return benefits. Your team's task is to collect evidence for them of how local governments serve the people. Each will collect different pieces of evidence, or artifacts, from your communities. Your team will collect them into a "Watchdog Portfolio" that could be shared with others.</p>

<h3>Step One: Identify Local Governments at Work</h3>

<p>All members of your team should explore the news through newspapers, websites, radio, or other means. From the media you can find out what local government may be doing. For example, you might see headlines about roads being repaired, new school buses purchased, or new rules for business owners in the city. Talk to trusted adults and ask them what local government does for the people. Ask them what their local taxes pay for. Pay attention as you travel in your community. For example, do you see workers digging up pipes along the road? Perhaps you notice a sidewalk where one had not existed before. Ask trusted adults questions about what you see to be sure that local government is responsible for the action.</p>
<p>You may use the discussion area or a Web 2.0 Tool to organize your team's work. Be sure you have a parent's and instructor's permission before using websites or communicating outside the course. The first section of the <strong>Collaboration Assessment Guide</strong> will help you organize your team.</p> 
 
 <h3>Step Two: Share with Your Team</h3>
 
 <p>As a team, discuss the ways you see local government at work in your communities. You will probably have similar items, but discussion may lead you to other examples you had not considered. If your team members live in different areas, you may find that some efforts are a priority in one community but not another. Make a list of the actions and the communities to which each applies.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>Watchdog Discussion Chart</strong> to organize your discussion for steps 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<h3>Step Three: Identify and Plan Evidence Collection</h3>

<p>Continue the discussion with your team by listing the artifacts, or pieces of evidence, that illustrate your group's chosen examples of local government action. Each member of your team should collect at least four artifacts. Each artifact should be unique. However, you could have evidence of the same activity happening in two different communities, such as a picture of roadwork in one city and roadwork in another city. Your artifacts can come in many different forms, all of one type or a mix of these</p>
<ul>
  <li>pictures or drawings</li>
  <li>short video clips</li>
  <li>newspaper or website articles</li>
  <li>radio broadcast recording</li>
  <li>interview with local official or community resident</li>
  <li>interview with workers paid by local government </li>
</ul>
<p>As a team, you need to make choices about what evidence each of you will collect. You should include a parent or guardian as well since you may need transportation to collect your evidence. Write notes about each artifact, explaining what it is and what it tells you about the work of local government. Your team also needs to discuss how you will put it together into one "Watchdog Portfolio." The portfolio can be as simple as a word processing file or as complex as a team website. You will need to discuss this with your team.</p>

<h3>Step Four: Collect Artifacts</h3>

<p>Each member of your team needs to collect the evidence agreed upon in the prior step. Be sure to set a date when this step should be complete for the team. Make sure you have one place to load your team's artifacts. Include your notes about what each artifact is and what it proves about local government in action.</p>

<p>Explain the consequences of that choice as well. What are the trade-offs? What would have been your second choice? What is the opportunity cost?</p>

<h3>Step Five: Prepare Watchdog Portfolio</h3>

<p>Your team members should help prepare the portfolio of evidence. Your portfolio can be a slideshow, word processing file, website, video, or other format. No matter which format you choose, the team's "Watchdog Portfolio" should include</p>
<ul>
  <li>  At least three artifacts for local government action per team member (For example, a team with three members should have at least nine artifacts at minimum. A team with five members would have at least 15 artifacts.)</li>
  <li>Description of each artifact</li>
  <li>Explanation of what the artifact proves to you about the work of local government </li>
</ul>
<h3>Step Six: Submit to Instructor</h3>

<p>There are <strong>two parts</strong> to your work in the collaboration activity. View the Grading Rubrics before completing and submitting this activity.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1</strong> &mdash; Once your team's discussion, artifact collecting, and "Watchdog Portfolio" are complete, you are ready to submit your Collaboration Project to assessment <strong>Collaboration Project Segment Two</strong>. Be sure to include</p>

<ul>
  <li>Watchdog Discussion Chart</li>
  <li>Watchdog Portfolio</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Part 2</strong> &mdash; The Collaboration Assessment Guide is where you plan, reflect on, and share your experiences of working with your team. After you have completed the collaboration activity, submit the completed Collaboration Assessment Guide to assessment <strong>S2 00 Collaboration Assessment Guide Segment Two</strong>. Make sure your Collaboration Assessment Guide includes</p>

<ul>
<li>Peer- and self-evaluation</li>
<li>Reflection</li>
<li>Evidence of collaboration</li>
</ul>
