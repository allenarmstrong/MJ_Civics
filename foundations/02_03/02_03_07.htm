<h1>How Can I Analyze the Declaration of Independence?</h1>
<p>We <span class="tooltip">analyze<span><strong>Analyze:</strong> to examine something in detail in order to understand it better, often by breaking it down into parts</span></span> a document, by focusing on small sections of the text one at a time. We figure out the meaning of new words or phrases to understand the whole document.</p>
<p>Do you write your assignments the same way you would talk? You probably do not. People usually pay more attention to correct grammar and spelling in a <span class="tooltip">formal<span><strong>Formal:</strong> official</span></span> writing task. The Declaration of Independence is a formal document. One reason the delegates chose Thomas Jefferson to write the document was because he was a skilled writer. The way people wrote and spoke in the 1700s was different from the way we write and speak today.</p>
