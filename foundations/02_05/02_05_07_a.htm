  <tr>
  <td valign="top">Coin and print currency</td>
  <td valign="top">Congress established the dollar as official U.S. currency in 1785. People use it in all 50 states and even foreign countries to pay for goods and services. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top">Declares war</td>
  <td valign="top">Congress last formally declared war against six countries in 1941–1942 as part of World War II. However, Congress may approve paying for and sending the military overseas without a formal war declaration. For example, Congress authorized sending troops to Afghanistan in 2001 but did not declare war on the country. As of 2011, U.S. troops were still serving in Afghanistan. They are working to protect freedom and security.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">Confirms federal officials</td>
  <td valign="top">When the president nominates someone for a federal position, the Senate holds a hearing. In this hearing, the Senate asks the nominee questions. The Senate can approve or reject the nominee. President Barack Obama nominated the former First Lady Hillary Clinton to be U.S. Secretary of State. On January 21, 2009, the Senate voted in favor of Clinton for the job. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top">Approves foreign treaties</td>
  <td valign="top">Presidents may meet and make treaties with foreign leaders, but the Senate must ratify the treaties. In 2010, the U.S. Senate approved a treaty called &ldquo;New START.&rdquo; President Barack Obama and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia agreed in this treaty to reduce and limit the amount of nuclear weapons. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">Raises taxes</td>
  <td valign="top">Congress has the power to create taxes that help support the work of government. For example, working Americans pay an income tax based on how much money they earn. This tax brings in the most money for the federal government and helps support important functions like military defense.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top">Makes laws &ldquo;necessary and proper&rdquo;</td>
  <td valign="top">This phrase gives Congress the power to create laws not specifically named in the Constitution. It is helpful because the Founding Fathers could not predict what the future would be and what Congress would need to do. With this phrase, Congress has defined many crimes as federal crimes. For example, kidnapping is a federal crime. This allows agencies like the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) to investigate and prosecute serious criminals, such as someone suspected of kidnapping another person.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">Regulates postal service</td>
  <td valign="top">This phrase allows Congress to create and maintain a method for delivering mail. In 1971, Congress passed the Postal Reorganization Act, giving the U.S. Postal Service more power to control how it operates. Email and other delivery companies have decreased the amount of mail the USPS delivers. Yet in 2010, the USPS employed more than 500,000 people and 218,000 vehicles. They deliver America&rsquo;s mail wherever it needs to go, rain or shine!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top">Determines naturalization process</td>
  <td valign="top">Congress has the power to decide how immigrants may become official U.S. citizens. Congress passed the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 for children under age 18 adopted from other countries. It allows many children to become U.S. citizens at the time of adoption.</td>

  <tr>
  <td valign="top">Approves and carries out laws passed by Congress</td>
  <td valign="top">When Congress passes a bill, the president can sign it into law. Then federal agencies that report to the president help carry out the law. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It includes many changes to health care for Americans. One example is that fast-food restaurants must display the calories of their food items in menus by 2014. Federal agencies in the executive branch will help enforce this rule by inspecting restaurants.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top">Can veto laws passed by Congress</td>
  <td valign="top">When Congress passes a bill, the president can either sign it into law or veto the bill. Note that Congress may override this veto if two-thirds of the members vote in favor of the bill. In 2007, President George W. Bush vetoed the U.S. Farm Bill. This act continues extra financial and research support to the agricultural industry. Congress overrode the veto and the bill became law.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">Meets with foreign leaders and makes agreements </td>
  <td valign="top">The president represents the United States to the rest of the world. Meeting with foreign leaders and use of diplomacy is part of the job. For about 30 years, it has been a tradition for new U.S. presidents to meet with the president of Mexico. This shows the close ties between the neighboring countries. In early 2009, President Barack Obama met with Mexican President Felipe Calderón in Washington, D.C.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top">Spends money authorized by Congress</td>
  <td valign="top">The president can propose changes to federal spending plans. When Congress approves payment for government programs, the president approves the payment, and the U.S. Treasury can then send the specific amounts to the right agencies. In 2010, the United States spent over $3 trillion.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">Appoints federal judges</td>
  <td valign="top">The president nominates a person to fill openings on the Supreme Court. The Senate must confirm the choice. Usually this does not happen often, as the justices serve for life. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor as the first female justice of the Supreme Court. She retired in 2006 from the court. Yet she remains very busy! In 2009, she launched a website called iCivics (insert link to www.icivics.org) with free games to teach students about how the government works. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top">Leads the military</td>
  <td valign="top">The president is the commander in chief of the military. Cooperating with Congress, the president can order and direct military actions. In 2001, after the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush ordered air strikes against those responsible hiding in Afghanistan. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top">Can grant pardons for federal crimes</td>
  <td valign="top">A pardon is forgiveness for a crime and official release from punishment. The Constitution grants the president the power to pardon people found guilty of federal crimes. A person would make a request for a pardon, which enters a review process. President Bill Clinton pardoned 140 people on January 21, 2001, his last day in office.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top">Gives yearly State of the Union speech</td>
  <td valign="top">The Constitution requires that the president report yearly to Congress on &ldquo;the state of the Union.&rdquo; In January of each year, the president describes current national conditions and his or her plans for the country to both parts of Congress. The media cover the event. Many State of the Union speeches have had memorable moments. President Ronald Reagan opened his speech in 1982 with a joke about his age. Then he mentioned a few famous quotes from great leaders.</td>

  <tr>
   <td valign="top">Settles constitutional disputes</td>
   <td valign="top">The U.S. Constitution is an enduring document. It continues  to meet the needs of the nation. The Supreme Court is responsible for  settling questions of the Constitution's meaning. It has this opportunity  only when a person or group brings the case to court to challenge a law. One  famous example is from the 1989 case <em>Texas  v. Johnson</em>. Mr. Johnson was arrested for burning an American flag in  public. The state of Texas had a law banning desecration of the American flag. Mr. Johnson  believed the law was against the Constitution. In this case, the Supreme  Court had to decide whether such actions are a part of freedom of speech, a  protected right in the Constitution. The Supreme Court ruled that the  Constitution protects symbolic  speech. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
   <td valign="top">Can declare a law unconstitutional</td>
   <td valign="top">The judicial branch has the power of judicial review. Judicial review is the power  of the courts to study whether actions of the legislative or judicial  branches go against the Constitution. When citizens bring a case to the  Supreme Court, it may review laws or acts of the other branches that relate  to the case. The court will determine if the law conflicts with the  Constitution. In 1996, Congress passed a law giving the president the power  to veto a part or parts of a new bill before signing it into law. Representatives  challenged this power in court, and the Supreme Court decided that the  Constitution gave the president power to veto an entire law only, not parts  of laws. Thus, the justices declared the law unconstitutional. Government  leaders continue to debate whether the president should have this power.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td valign="top">Oversees the courts and appeals process</td>
   <td valign="top">The Supreme Court is the only court mentioned in the  Constitution. However, there are federal courts throughout the United States  to serve the citizens. The Supreme Court receives over 10,000 requests to appeal cases each year. It  chooses cases based on whether the justices determine they have the power to  review the case. If not, the decision of the last court to hear the case  remains. If the Supreme Court hears the case, the justices may still decide  that the last court's decision was correct. In March 2011, the Supreme Court  dismissed the case of <em>Tolentino v. New </em>York.  Mr. Tolentino was arrested for driving with a suspended license. He  challenged that the officer stopped him in the first place without a reason.  The Supreme Court dismissed the case, and Mr. Tolentino's arrest will remain. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
   <td valign="top">Interprets the laws</td>
   <td valign="top">The Supreme Court and other federal courts have the  authority to say how law enforcement and court should apply the law. In the 1966  case of <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em>,the Supreme Court ruled that what  suspects say could only be used in a trial if they knew of and gave up their  rights to remain silent and have an attorney present. Now officers and  investigators are sure to remind suspects of their rights before questioning.  Otherwise, what the suspect says or writes may not be heard in court.</td>
