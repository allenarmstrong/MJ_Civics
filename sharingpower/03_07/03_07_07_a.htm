  <p>The judge asked the attorneys to introduce themselves. Let&rsquo;s hear   their opening arguments.</p>
  <p><strong>Plaintiff&rsquo;s Attorney (audio):</strong> Good morning members of the jury,   judge, and all of you with us today. I am Emile Proofinder, representing the plaintiff, Suzy Snoozer.   Ms. Snoozer awoke late one summer morning to find her birds missing that she   left in their cage outside overnight for air. We will prove to you today that   her neighbor, Ms. Felina Early, was negligent in allowing her cats to attack and kill Ms. Snoozer&rsquo;s   birds. Ms. Snoozer is seeking compensation for the loss of her beloved birds and her pain and   suffering.</p>
  <p><strong>Defense Attorney (audio):</strong><strong> </strong>Judge, jury, and respected citizens—good morning.   I am Bobby Refuter, today representing Ms. Felina Early. Today I will show   you that the plaintiff lacks the evidence to prove Ms. Early is liable for the loss of Ms.   Snoozer&rsquo;s birds. The loss of her birds is unfortunate. However, falsely   placing blame and forcing compensation will not replace the birds.</p>

 <p>The judge indicates that the plaintiff should call the first witness.   Choose a witness to examine: </p>

</ol>  
<h4>5a.1</h4>
      <p>(<em>Image: Amy Anticattus on the witness stand with Attorney Proofinder in front of her</em>)</p>
      <p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Please   state your name and relationship to the defendant. </p>
      <p><strong>Anticattus: </strong>My name   is Amy Anticattus. I have been Ms. Snoozer&rsquo;s and Ms. Early&rsquo;s neighbor for 11   years.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Please   tell us what you witnessed. </p>
      <p><strong>Anticattus: </strong>Well,   that morning I woke up to the most panicked screams! I jumped out of bed and   rushed outside. I saw Ms. Snoozer on her front porch, staring at the birdcage   and clearly upset. I could see the door was open and yellow feathers were everywhere.&nbsp; The birds were gone.</p>
      <p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Did you   see anything else?</p>
      <p><strong>Anticattus: </strong>Yes! I   looked around for the birds and saw Ms. Early&rsquo;s cat sneaking around the side   of Ms. Snoozer&rsquo;s garage. It had a yellow feather clinging to its back.</p>
      <p><strong>Proofinder</strong>: Thank   you, Ms. Anticattus. No more questions, your Honor.</p>
<p>(<em>Image: Amy Anticattus on the witness stand with Attorney Refuter in front of her</em>)</p>
<p>The judge says that the defense may now cross-examine the witness.</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Ms.   Anticattus, you said you saw Ms. Early&rsquo;s cat sneaking around the garage. How   do you know it was her cat?</p>
<p><strong>Anticattus: </strong>The cat   is very distinctive. It has a broad face with unique markings. I would know   it anywhere. In addition, it&rsquo;s always sneaking around Ms. Snoozer&rsquo;s garage.   It seems to be the cat&rsquo;s favorite hangout.</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>So   then, it is possibly just a coincidence   the cat was nearby, right, if it hangs around there often? </p>
<p><strong>Anticattus: </strong>But the   feather—there was a yellow feather on it! I have seen the cat often brushing   against the cage before Ms. Snoozer awakes. It is always trying to figure out   how to get in! I shooed it away myself many times!</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>So Ms.   Snoozer knew about the threat but failed to protect her birds--</p>
<p><strong>Anticattus: </strong>No, no,   you misunderstand!</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Thank   you, Ms. Anticattus. No more questions, your Honor.</p>
<p>Did you call both witnesses?</p>

</ol>  
<h4>5a.3</h4>
<p>(<em>Image: Animus Arresta on the witness stand with Attorney Proofinder in front of her</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Please   state your name and relationship to the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Arresta: </strong>Animus   Arresta, chief animal control officer for the county. I have visited Ms.   Early&rsquo;s home several times, responding to complaints of her wandering cat.</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Who   made the complaints and why, Mr. Arresta?</p>
<p><strong>Arresta: </strong>Well, I   can&rsquo;t tell you who made the complaints and still keep my job. I can say,   though, that the cat is a menace. It roams free outside each morning. It   snarls at children, attacks wildlife, and prowls on others&rsquo; property. </p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>So the   cat has a history of showing aggression?</p>
<p><strong>Arresta: </strong>Definitely.   I once responded to a call about a dead mouse on a doorstep. The family   didn&rsquo;t own a cat, but Ms. Early&rsquo;s cat is often in their yard. I have reminded   Ms. Early often that cats, just like dogs, must be on a leash by law when   outdoors, but well…</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Thank   you, Mr. Arresta. No more questions, your Honor.<strong></strong></p>
<p>(<em>Image: Animus Arresta on the witness stand with Attorney Refuter in front of her</em>)</p>
<p>The judge says that the defense may now cross-examine the witness.</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Mr.   Arresta, in your job as an animal control officer, you know much about   animals&rsquo; nature, do you not?</p>
<p><strong>Arresta: </strong>I   absolutely do. I began my career studying to be a veterinarian, but a case of   cat scratch fever put an end to that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>So it   would be perfectly natural for a cat to go after squirrels, mice, and birds,   would it not?</p>
<p><strong>Arresta: </strong>Of   course, and that&rsquo;s why we have animal control laws, to prevent this kind of   heartbreak.</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Then   Ms. Snoozer should also know, as a bird owner, to protect her birds from any   known menace, should she not? Isn&rsquo;t she responsible for the control of her   own animals? </p>
<p><strong>Arresta: </strong>Well   yes, but, I think you&rsquo;re twisting my words! </p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Thank   you, Mr. Arresta. No more questions, your Honor.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Did you call both witnesses?</p>

<p>The court reporter is busy making a transcript. The judge reminds the jury to listen   fairly to all the evidence. The jurors are making notes. Are you?</p>
<p>The judge invites the defense attorney to call a witness. Choose a   witness to examine.</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Tayme Dibeast—<strong>Continue to 6a.1.</strong></li>
  <li>Pax Plantis—<strong>Skip to 6a.3.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>6a.1</h4>
<p>(<em>Image: Tayme Dibeast on the witness stand with Attorney Refuter in front of her</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Please   state your name and relationship to the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Dibeast: </strong>Hello,   my name is Tayme Dibeast. I am an animal trainer. I helped Felina Early tame   her cat. She rescued it from the animal shelter where I volunteer. It was a   wild cat.</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>So is   it safe to say that Ms. Early is a lover of all animals?&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t put her own cat or   others&rsquo; animals in danger on purpose, correct?<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dibeast: </strong>Oh,   absolutely! Her cat is in excellent health. Ms. Early was very enthusiastic   about the training and practiced often. She only lets the cat outside in the   early mornings, before the neighbors are out. </p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Would   this cat be likely to have attacked Ms. Snoozer&rsquo;s birds?</p>
<p><strong>Dibeast: </strong>Absolutely   not, the cat knows to leave other pets alone. Besides, Ms. Early supervises   her cat while it is outside.</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Thank   you, Ms. Dibeast. No more questions, your Honor.</p>
<p>(<em>Image: Tayme Dibeast on the witness stand with Attorney Proofinder in front of her</em>)</p>
<p>The judge says that the plaintiff may now cross-examine the witness.</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Ms.   Dibeast, you said you are an animal trainer. Could you teach an animal, say a   cat, to open doors or cages? </p>
<p><strong>Dibeast: </strong>Hmm, it   is possible if you had the right kind of handle. However, I did not teach Ms.   Early&rsquo;s cat to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Yet you   said Ms. Early was &ldquo;very enthusiastic&rdquo; about the trainings. Might she have   extended her cat&rsquo;s tricks on her own?</p>
<p><strong>Dibeast: </strong>Again,   it&rsquo;s possible, but Ms. Early supervises her cat. She lets it capture the   occasional mouse that gets in her garden, just like any normal cat. However,   it&rsquo;s not unlocking the gate or anything.</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Oh, Ms.   Early is annoyed by <em>some</em> animals—like singing canaries? Is it possible she opened the canaries&rsquo; cage   herself? </p>
<p><strong>Dibeast: </strong>No,   that is not the point</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Thank   you, Ms. Dibeast. No more questions, your Honor.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Did you call both witnesses?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Yes—<strong>Skip to 7a.</strong></li>
  <li>No—<strong>Skip to 6a and choose your next witness.</strong></li>
</ol> 
<h4>6a.3</h4>
<p>(<em>Image: Pax Plantis on the witness stand with Attorney Refuter in front of him</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Please   state your name and relationship to the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Plantis: </strong>Yes, of   course. I am Pax Plantis, Felina Early&rsquo;s friend and lawn maintenance man. I   do yard work for her every Tuesday morning, then we go to breakfast. </p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>What   can you tell me about Ms. Early, Ms. Snoozer, and their pets?</p>
<p><strong>Plantis: </strong>Every   Tuesday the birds are outside singing when I show up. Ms. Snoozer gets them   when I start working. My tools must wake her up. Ms. Early is always outside   to greet me with her cat. </p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>How   does Ms. Snoozer act when she retrieves the birds?</p>
<p><strong>Plantis: </strong>She is   angry. She gives dirty looks to Felina, the cat, and me. I think the noise   irritates her and her birds, though I arrive at a decent hour. She is always   in her robe and the birds are plucking their feathers. This is a sign that   the birds are feeling stress.</p>
<p><strong>Refuter: </strong>Thank   you Mr. Plantis. No more questions, your Honor.</p>
<p>(<em>Image: Pax Plantis on the witness stand with Attorney Proofinder in front of him</em>)</p>
<p>The judge says that the plaintiff may now cross-examine the witness.</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Mr.   Plantis, you have been Ms. Early&rsquo;s friend for years. How does she feel about   Ms. Snoozer?</p>
<p><strong>Plantis: </strong>Well,   she does not understand why Ms. Snoozer is so irritable. She only puts her   cat out when Ms. Snoozer is sleeping, even though the canaries keep her up   all night with their singing.</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Hmm, So   Ms. Early really doesn&rsquo;t like the canaries, does she?</p>
<p><strong>Plantis: </strong>Who   would if you couldn&rsquo;t get any sleep? Honestly…</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>So   perhaps she did let the cat attack Ms. Snoozer&rsquo;s innocent birds, to get some   sleep? </p>
<p><strong>Plantis: </strong>I don&rsquo;t   think Felina would</p>
<p><strong>Proofinder: </strong>Thank   you, Mr. Plantis. No more questions, your Honor.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Did you call both witnesses?</p>

<h4>7a</h4>
<p>(<em>Image: close ups of plaintiff’s attorney and defense attorney with their respective client</em>)</p>
<p>After confirming there are no more witnesses, the judge tells the   attorneys to make their closing arguments. Let&rsquo;s listen to them.</p>
<p><strong>Plaintiff&rsquo;s Attorney (audio):</strong> Members of the jury, you have   heard the facts for yourself. Ms. Early is clearly responsible for the   untimely loss of Ms. Snoozer&rsquo;s birds. She did not like them, trained her cat   to attack animals that bothered her, and let her cat roam outside in the   mornings. Deliver justice by awarding compensation to Ms. Snoozer.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney (audio):</strong><strong> </strong>Members of the jury, the plaintiff has failed to   prove Ms. Early is responsible for the loss of the birds. She clearly   respects her neighbors, even those who are not respectful. She cares for her   cat and supervises it well. Ms. Snoozer&rsquo;s loss, though unfortunate, is due to   her own failure to supervise her birds.</p>
<p>(<em>Image: close up of the judge</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Judge</strong> (audio): Members of the   jury, you have heard both sides of this case. Your community depends on you   to consider the evidence fairly and make a wise decision. Please keep these   points in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must follow the law. The question here   is whether Ms. Felina Early is responsible for the loss of Ms. Snoozer&rsquo;s   birds. You must determine this based on the evidence available, not any assumptions you may make.</li>
  <li>Do not make a decision based on feeling   sorry or angry with anyone involved in the case, including the attorneys.   Your feelings about anyone in this room should not affect your decision.</li>
  <li>Your decision as a jury must be unanimous. Each juror must   agree to the same verdict.</li>
</ul>
<p>The judge excuses the jury to another room to discuss the case. Review the main points of the case in your notes. </p>

<p>The Judge asked the attorneys to introduce themselves. Let&rsquo;s hear   their opening arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecuting Attorney (audio):</strong> Good morning members of the   Jury, Judge, and all of you with us today. I am Jesse Jailem, representing   our government and the laws that protect respectful citizens like you. Today   I will prove to you that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. He broke several laws by robbing a   video game store. The laws he broke are destruction of property, unlawful   entry, and robbery. Police arrested this young man, Justin B. Goode, the day   after the incident. He plead   not guilty at his arraignment. Despite the   evidence against him, he refused the plea bargain offered.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney (audio):</strong><strong> </strong>Judge, jury, respected citizens—good morning. I   am Orrie Defendorr, today representing Justin B. Goode. Attorney Jailem has   the burden of proof, meaning that Mr. Goode is innocent until proven guilty with facts and   evidence. Today I will show you that the prosecution lacks the evidence   necessary to prove Mr. Goode is guilty of breaking any law beyond a   reasonable doubt. He is a respectful citizen just like you. He rightly plead   not guilty and refused a plea bargain. You should find him not guilty of   these charges. </p>

<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>Please   state your name and relationship to the defendant. </p>
<p><strong>Bizz: </strong>My name   is Runnuh Bizz. I own the video game store that was broken into and robbed.   Justin comes in the store all the time. The day before the break-in, he   yelled at me.</p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>Please   tell us about the break-in and the robbery.</p>
<p><strong>Bizz: </strong>My   alarm company called at 2 a.m. to tell me the alarms were going off. I called   the police and went to the shop. The front window was in pieces and all the   game systems were gone. Glass was everywhere. I made a police report and   listed what was missing.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>Please   tell us what was missing.</p>
<p><strong>Bizz: </strong>I had   10 of the hot new 4D systems and 8 pre-owned systems on the shelves that are   missing now. Justin had been drooling over the 4D for weeks, begging for a discount.   He told me he was trying to save money for it. The last time he said this was   about a week before the argument and break-in. </p>

<p>The judge says that the defense may now cross-examine the witness.</p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Ms.   Bizz, you said you and Mr. Goode had an argument. Please tell us about it.</p>
<p><strong>Bizz: </strong>Well, I   sell new and pre-owned video games and systems. Justin wanted to sell me a   game that was old. He was angry and called me names because I would not buy   it. I know I could not have sold it again. I have to make a profit.</p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Is Mr.   Goode the only customer who was ever angry in your store?</p>
<p><strong>Bizz: </strong>Well,   no. Sometimes people fail to read store policy before trying to sell their   items. When I will not buy the items, the people are confused and upset.&nbsp; I usually am able to settle the   situation though.</p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>So Mr.   Goode would not be the only person in town angry enough to get revenge,   right?</p>
<p><strong>Bizz: </strong>I, well   no, I know it was him!</p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Thank   you, Ms. Bizz. No more questions, your Honor.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>Please   state your name and relationship to the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Pihshawn: </strong>Suss   Pihshawn, Chief of Police. </p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>What   did you discover at the scene of the crime?</p>
<p><strong>Pihshawn: </strong>Ms.   Bizz has video monitoring. Mr. Goode is all over it, from smashing the   windows to taking out the game systems to leaving before we arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>Did you   find anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Pihshawn: </strong>Yes, we   found fingerprints on the door and counter matching Mr. Goode&rsquo;s fingerprints. </p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>Thank   you, Chief Pihshawn. No more questions, your Honor.<strong></strong></p>
<p>(<em>Image: Suss Pihshawn on the witness stand with Attorney Defendorr in front of her</em>)</p>
<p>The judge says that the defense may now cross-examine the witness.</p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Chief   Pihshawn, in your investigation, did you find Mr. Goode&rsquo;s fingerprints in the   areas around the smashed window or missing game systems? </p>
<p><strong>Pihshawn: </strong>Well   no, but along with the video and the altercation the day before, we had enough to arrest him.</p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Did you   use face recognition software to identify him in the video?</p>
<p><strong>Pihshawn: </strong>No, but   we did try. The video never shows his whole face at once. He had his hoodie   on over his head as well.</p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>So you   identified Mr. Goode based on fingerprints that should have been there from   his visit anyway. In addition, because of Ms. Bizz&rsquo;s story you decided he was   in the video although the image was not clear. That sounds like a poor   investigation to me.</p>
<p><strong>Pihshawn: </strong>No,   sir, my officers were very</p>

<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Please   state your name and relationship to the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Rool: </strong>Hello,   my name is Tech Rool, teacher at Gaming Senior Academy.&nbsp; Justin is in my programming class. </p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>What   kind of a student is Mr. Goode?<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Rool: </strong>He&rsquo;s a   wonderful student! Average grades, but he has incredible talent. He often   assists other students with their projects. </p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Do you   think Justin could have robbed this store?</p>
<p><strong>Rool: </strong>No, of   course he would not. He was trying to save money for the new game system. He   respects my class rules and the other students. I cannot imagine him breaking   the law.</p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Thank   you, Mr. Rool. No more questions, your Honor.</p>
<p>(<em>Image: Tech Rool on the witness stand with Attorney Jailem in front of her</em>)</p>
<p>The judge says that the prosecution may now cross-examine the witness.</p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>Mr.   Rool, you said Mr. Goode has &ldquo;average&rdquo; grades. Why would that be if he were   so talented?</p>
<p><strong>Rool: </strong>He   often forgets to turn in paperwork or it is incomplete. He much prefers the   hands-on programming work we do most days.</p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>So he&rsquo;s   talented, but not a hard worker. </p>
<p><strong>Rool: </strong>Well,   he works hard on the tasks he enjoys, just like most of my students. That   does not make him a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>It does   mean he might get too impatient saving money for a game system. He loves   gaming so much he could get desperate enough to steal, right? </p>
<p><strong>Rool: </strong>That&rsquo;s   unfair—and not what I meant! </p>

<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Please   state your name and relationship to the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Gaimer: </strong>Yes, of   course. I am Vet Gaimer, Justin B. Goode&rsquo;s friend and neighbor. I have known   him and his family for years. We sometimes challenge each other in games. We   have our systems wirelessly connected. It&rsquo;s awesome. </p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>Were   you home the night of the robbery? What can you tell us about it?</p>
<p><strong>Gaimer: </strong>I was   up, playing games, of course, and Justin signed off around 11 p.m. He must   have gone to bed. I did not hear any cars all night. He was up early mowing   the lawn the next day and putting out huge garbage bags of yard debris. His   parents give him allowance for working on the yard. </p>
<p><strong>Defendorr: </strong>What   did he tell you about the incident with Ms. Buzz?</p>
<p><strong>Gaimer: </strong>Oh, he   was sorry for it. He was having a bad day because he had to spend some of his   savings to fix his computer. Justin said he would go back in a couple days   and apologize. But then, well, he was arrested …</p>

<p>The judge says that the prosecution may now cross-examine the witness.</p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>Mr.   Gaimer, you have been Mr. Goode&rsquo;s friend for years. Is he involved in any   activities or work outside school?</p>
<p><strong>Gaimer: </strong>No, he   was hoping to get a job at Ms. Bizz&rsquo;s store but she had no openings. However,   he is working on his own video game while teaching himself advanced   programming skills.</p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>Hmm, so   Mr. Goode has no extra activities or responsibilities, other than the yard,   apparently. Perhaps he thought he would make some money by selling stolen game   systems?</p>
<p><strong>Gaimer: </strong>What?!   No, I mean, I would have seen him if he had stolen all those game systems.   The criminal would have been busy the next day trying to get rid of them   quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Jailem: </strong>You   have a good point there, Mr. Gaimer. Perhaps that idea comes from experience.   Maybe you bought one of the stolen systems. I bet you helped him bag up the   packaging into those large yard waste bags.</p>
<p><strong>Gaimer: </strong>That&rsquo;s ridiculous!</p>

<p>(<em>Image: close ups of prosecuting attorney and defense attorney with respective clients</em>)</p>
<p>After confirming there are no more witnesses, the judge tells the   attorneys to make their closing arguments. Let&rsquo;s listen to them.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecuting Attorney Jailem (audio):</strong> Members of the jury, you have heard the facts for yourself. Mr. Goode clearly   had a motive and the means to break in and rob   Ms. Bizz&rsquo;s store. He wanted revenge and he wanted that new game system   desperately. His grades in school show he is willing to take the lazy route   to meeting goals—like stealing instead of working hard and saving money. </p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Defendorr (audio):</strong><strong> </strong>Members of the jury, the prosecution has failed   to prove Mr. Goode broke the law. The evidence is weak and easily explained.   Justin B. Goode is a law-abiding young citizen, working hard to achieve his   future goals in computer programming and gaming. Recognize that even a sliver   of doubt about his guilt, and there is plenty of doubt here, means you cannot   convict him. He is   not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by law.</p>
<p>(<em>Image: close up of the judge</em>)</p>
<p>The judge turns to you and the other jury members. Select the judge to   hear his instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Judge</strong> (audio): Members of the   jury, you have heard both sides of this case. Your community depends on you   to consider the evidence fairly and make a wise decision. Please keep these   points in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must follow the law. The question here   is whether Justin B. Goode broke the laws against destruction of property,   unlawful entry, and robbery. You must determine this based on the evidence   available and not any assumptions   you may make.</li>
  <li>Do not make a decision based on feeling   sorry or angry with anyone involved in the case, including the attorneys.   Your feelings about anyone in this room should not affect your decision.</li>
  <li>Your decision as a jury must be unanimous. Each juror must   agree to the same verdict.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The judge excuses the jury to another room to discuss the case. Review   the main points of the case in your notes. </p>
<p>Prosecution (Attorney Stater) Arguments</p>
<ul>
      <li>Justin B. Goode&rsquo;s image appears in the     security video at time of robbery.</li>
      <li>His fingerprints were near the door and     counter.</li>
      <li>He had an argument with the shop owner the     day before.</li>
      <li>He was saving for a new game system and the     saving was not going well.</li>
      <li>He is a lazy student, prone to unlawful     action to get what he wants.</li>
      <li>No one can confirm his location at the time     of robbery.</li>
      <li>He does not work nor is he involved in     school activities.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Defense (Justin B. Goode) Arguments</p> 
 <ul>
      <li>The police could not confirm his image in     the security video.</li>
      <li>The fingerprints make sense where they were     as he recently visited the store.</li>
      <li>Other people have had arguments with the     shop owner as well. Besides, he planned to apologize.</li>
      <li>He was saving money by doing yard work for     his parents.</li>
      <li>He is a very talented and kind student,     eager to help others.</li>
      <li>He was in bed at the time of the robbery and     up early the next morning.</li>
      <li>He had no opportunity to dump or sell the     stolen game systems.</li>
