<h1>Should Countries Produce Multiple Products?</h1>
<p>The different resources of a country will affect the goods and services it produces. Most countries produce a wide variety of products. They focus on what they can produce best and most <span class="tooltip">efficiently<span><strong>Efficient:</strong> well organized and able to achieve goals with a minimum of resources, time, and effort</span></span>, and they trade for the things they cannot produce as well.</p>
<p>Some countries focus most of their resources on a single good or service. The people can be very skilled and efficient at producing that product. These countries must import most of the products they need.</p>
<p>Try this activity to compare the effects of a country that focuses on producing a single product with another that produces multiple products.</p>

    		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
<strong>Chocolate Land and Lollipop Land are two island countries in a warm climate. Both grow large amounts of sugarcane. </strong>
</p> 
<div class="leftish">
<strong>Lollipop Land's main crop is sugar.</strong> The people there focus on making lollipops from it. The country is famous around the world for its lollipops. Most people work in the sugar cane fields or in the factories that make the lollipops. The people have been using the same recipes for over 100 years. They are very proud of their traditions and resist new ideas that would change their ways.  
</div>
<div class="leftish">
<strong>Chocolate Land grows cocoa beans and many crops in addition to sugar.</strong> It also has dairy farms. Its major products are cocoa powder, chocolate candies and desserts, milk, butter, cheese, and beef. The people grow some fruits and grains, mostly used to make interesting chocolate flavors. They also make lollipops, including chocolate ones, but not as many. Chocolate Land also has a theme park that attracts tourists. There you can ride chocolate-themed rides and learn the history of making chocolate on the island. Hotels are near the park as well as shops selling shirts and postcards.

It can clean up the resort and park areas to encourage tourists to come back.
