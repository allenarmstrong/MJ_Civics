        <h1>What Are Some Examples of Art Inspiring Action?</h1>
        <p>The Civil Rights Movement and migrant workers during the Great Depression both have significant representation in American art. Music, stories, and photographs bring these events to life even years after they happened.</p>
        <p>The actions of people involved in the Civil Rights Movement encouraged Congress to pass new laws protecting the rights of African Americans. One example is the Civil Rights Act of 1965.</p>
        <p>Public outcry at the conditions of migrant farm workers during the Great Depression encouraged Congress to create policies that would assist those families in need. The government sent emergency food and set up camps where the migrant workers could live while working in an area.</p>
        <p>View this presentation to see examples of art from both movements.</p>

              <p>The Civil Rights Movement is famous for the many songs that people sang to emphasize their goals. Americans from across the nation gathered in Washington, D.C. in 1963. They showed support for laws that would protect equal rights for African Americans. They heard civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King speak to the importance of their cause. "We Shall Overcome" is one of the most famous songs the marchers sang there. Many artists recorded their own versions of the song.</p>

            	<h4>Migrant Farm Workers during the Great Depression </h4>
              <p>Dorothea Lange, working for the U.S. government, took this photograph in 1936. Her job was to document the lives of migrant farm workers. Florence Thompson was a 32-year old mother of six when Lange photographed her near a migrant farm workers' camp in California. She had traveled with her family from Oklahoma. Her husband had recently died and the family car was broken down. Americans saw this image of a hungry, dirty, anxious woman and her children. They demanded government action to bring relief to the migrant workers.

              <p>The Great Depression was a time of economic hardship across the United States. Farmers in the Plains states had a particularly tough time. Their land was worn out and weather conditions made things worse. Many headed west, like Florence Thompson, hoping for a better life. Watch this video to learn more.</p>

They became migrant farm workers, following harvest seasons. For example, when it was time to pick potatoes people headed to potato farms asking for work. Then they would move on to the next farm needing work. However, so many people competed for the same jobs that the migrants often had trouble finding work. The U.S. government set up camps where the people could live for a short while. The conditions were poor. Other people looked down on them and were sometimes cruel. The John Steinbeck novel The Grapes of Wrath describes the challenges of one migrant family from the Dust Bowl and how they stuck together to survive. The novel also helped bring attention and concern to the struggles of migrant farm workers.</p></div>
