<h1>What Does the Government Budget?</h1>
<p>Local, state, and federal governments create budgets just like individuals and households. The name for government income is <span class="tooltip">revenue<span><strong>Revenue:</strong> income, often used in reference to government or business income</span></span>. The main revenue for governments is taxes. The types of taxes they collect vary. For example, <span class="tooltip">sales taxes<span><strong>Sales Tax:</strong> money paid to government based on the exchange of goods and services</span></span> are common at the local and state level. If you live in a state with 5% sales tax, you would pay 5% on top of the purchase price for a product. Therefore, if a movie ticket cost $10 you would pay $10.50 total. The federal <span class="tooltip">income tax<span><strong>Income Tax:</strong> money paid to government based on earnings</span></span> is the main source of revenue for the federal government. It is paid directly to the federal government based on what a person earns.</p>
<p>Just like individuals and households, a government has both fixed and variable expenses. You can see the many types of expenses in this chart. National defense is a variable expense as well as a large part of the budget. The chart shows you what percentage or portion of the budget was spent on a category. Some of the money represented in the chart goes to state and local governments to fund programs within those categories.</p>
<p>Local governments spend tax money on needs within their communities like repairing roads and paying firefighters. State governments spend tax money on programs that benefit the whole state like new highways and supporting colleges.</p>
