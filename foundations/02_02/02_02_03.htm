<h1>What Documents Influenced the American Colonists?</h1>
<p>From about the 1750s, American colonists grew increasingly unhappy with British rule. Some were very angry. They thought the British <span class="tooltip">monarch<span><strong>Monarch:</strong> a supreme ruler of a territory, usually a king or queen, usually for life and by hereditary right</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">Parliament<span><strong>Parliament:</strong> the name given to the legislative branch of government in Britain and other countries</span></span> did not govern them fairly. By the mid-1770s, many Americans thought the British government was a <span class="tooltip">tyranny<span><strong>Tyranny:</strong> a government in which a single ruler possesses and abuses absolute power, or the abusive use of power</span></span>.</p>
<p>Britain had colonies all over the world at this time. Unlike people in other colonies, many Americans were from or descended from British families. Most American colonists saw themselves as British <span class="tooltip">citizens<span><strong>Citizen:</strong> a person who is native or naturalized to a country</span></span>. Events and writers in Britain shaped their ideas about government.</p>
