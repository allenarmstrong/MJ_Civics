<h2>Why Are There So Many Rules? Text Version</h2>
<p>(Young teenager walks across the field in front of the school and his backpack falls off his shoulder. Books fall out of it.)</p>
<p><strong>Carl:</strong> Why me?</p>
<p><strong>Abby:</strong> Because you don't take very good care of that backpack and throw it all over the place. Here, let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>Carl:</strong> Thanks, Abby.</p>
<p><strong>Abby:</strong> You don't look like you're having a very good day.</p>
<p><strong>Carl:</strong> Oh, didn't you know? Today is Pick On Carl Day.</p>
<p><strong>Abby:</strong> What happened now?</p>
<p><strong>Carl:</strong> What didn't? Everything! It started this morning when I ran out of time and had to rush to put the trash on the curb. Well, I didn't rush fast enough, because I was late for school, but not so late that Mr. Keenan couldn't stop and give me detention for running in the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>Abby:</strong> And when did this vast anti-Carl come into this?</p>
<p><strong>Carl:</strong> There's so many stupid rules that I'm supposed to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Law &amp; the Teenager</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abby: </strong>Rules and laws are fact of life and it's easier to just accept them.</p>
<p><strong>Carl: </strong>That doesn't mean they're fair. I have to get up, finish my homework, take out the trash, get to school on time, walk in the hallway, do not run, be quiet, don't chew gum, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p><strong>Rules and Laws Prevent Chaos</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abby: </strong>We have to have rules and laws in society or else there would be chaos.<strong> </strong>Besides, teenagers have fewer laws stacked up against us than ever before.</p>
