<ol>
  <li>Federalism!—Under federalism, the nation has local, state, and national levels of government. The U.S. Constitution describes the powers of the national level and reserves other powers to the states.</li>
  <li>Constitution Collision!—Each of the 50 states has its own constitution. The state constitutions are very similar to the U.S. Constitution. For example, Florida has three branches of government, like the national government. The U.S. Constitution is supreme over all state constitutions.</li>
  <li>Rule of Law!—People in the United States obey laws that officials create at each level. Without the rule of law, society would fall into chaos. No one is above the law.</li>
  <li>Make a Law!—The lawmaking process begins with an idea.  The idea may become a bill.  People and officials discuss and debate a bill through the many steps it must follow. Most bills do not become laws.</li>
  <li>Navigating the Courts!—At both the state and federal levels, cases begin in a trial court. People may be able to take their case to an appellate court for review. The U.S. Supreme Court is the court of last resort.</li>
  <li>Duty Calls!—U.S. citizens serve on juries in trial courts. People have the right to be judged by a jury of ordinary citizens. The trial process includes the jury hearing evidence from both sides of the case. </li>
  <li>Solve It!—People can help resolve issues in their community. They identify problems and explore ways to address them. They contact officials, groups, and other citizens to find support and turn their ideas into action.</li>
