<h2>Headlines Text Version</h2>
<h3>State Law Bans the Flag</h3>
 <p>A new state law bans the wearing of clothing on which an American flag appears. Supporters of the law say it is to protect the integrity of an important symbol to the nation. People who wear tattered or inappropriate clothing depicting the flag or its pattern are disrespectful, they say. Those against the law say that those who choose to wear images of the flag are not disrespectful at all, but among the most patriotic. They say this law is unnecessary and a violation of free speech rights.</p>
  <h3>In Error</h3>
  <p>Yesterday we printed on the editorial page that none of the candidates for mayor had all the qualifications for the office. Mr. Faute took offense and contacted our staff yesterday. He requested that we print his list of qualifications, which we have gladly done as part of an article on all of the candidates (see page 3). However, the editor and staff of this paper do maintain that it is our right under the First Amendment to express opinions as such on the editorial page. We regret that Mr. Faute, or any other candidate, disagrees.</p>
  <h3>More Teen Drivers?</h3>
  <p>Teens around the state are gathering signatures for a new petition. They hope to add an item to this year&rsquo;s election ballot about reducing the driving age. Many report that being able to work at 15 but not able to drive until 16 causes hardship. Teens as young as 13 have been sighted talking to registered voters in the hopes of gaining another signature. Statewide, the teens need at least 500,000 signatures of voters to have a successful petition. &ldquo;This is nonsense,&rdquo; said Governor Fadaisie yesterday. &ldquo;The law is about safety, not convenience.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3>No Block Party for Local Church</h3>
  <p> A local church was denied their application for a block party during the holiday weekend. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tradition,&rdquo; protested church member Sara Swaray. &ldquo;Our church has held a worship weekend each year of the last 14 years. We just want to expand our festivities outside.&rdquo; Local officials denied the application because of concerns over traffic during the busiest traveling day of the year. The church is located along the beachfront road. Council Chair Legit said, &ldquo;We just do not have enough officers anymore to direct traffic and protect safety. We did not reject the application for any other reason.&rdquo; Church leaders believe they have a right to hold their event. They say that the denial takes away their right to worship as they please.</p>
