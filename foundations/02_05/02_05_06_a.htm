<h2>The Legislative Branch Text Version</h2>
<p>Our Federal government has three branches - Legislative, to make laws, Executive to enforce laws, and Judicial to decide what the laws mean.</p>
<p>The Legislative Branch is divided into two parts, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate and the House of Representatives are known as Congress. Congress does it work in the United States capital in Washington, D.C. The Senate holds its meetings in one end of the Capital and the House of Representatives hold their meetings in the other end. The two groups are considered equal in power. They can both make laws and both of them must agree on a law before it can be approved. The members of Congress are elected people from each state that do the work of the Nation.</p>
<p>To be elected to Congress, a person must receive the majority of votes from the people in their state. The people in Congress are all representatives in our Federal government. They make the laws that they believe the people of our country want to have.</p>
