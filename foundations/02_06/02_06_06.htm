<h1>Do Checks and Balances Give Enough Protection?</h1>
<p>The separation of powers and system of checks and balances limit the power of the government. However, at the time of writing the Constitution, not everyone agreed that these limits were enough. For the Constitution to take effect, at least nine states had to ratify, or approve, it. Each state held its own convention to vote on ratifying the Constitution.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip">Federalists<span><strong>Federalist:</strong> a delegate to the Constitutional Convention who supported the ratification of the Constitution and a strong national government</span></span> were a group of people who supported the ratification of the Constitution and a strong national government. <span class="tooltip">Anti-federalists<span><strong>Anti-federalist:</strong> a delegate to the Constitutional Convention who opposed the ratification of the Constitution without a separate list of individual and state rights</span></span> were a group of people who opposed the ratification of the Constitution. They argued over the structure of the Constitution during the <span class="tooltip">Constitutional Convention<span><strong>Constitutional Convention:</strong> the 1787 meetings of delegates from the U.S. states to address problems in the Articles of Confederation</span></span> and in the months that followed.</p>

<p>This map shows the support for the Constitution by areas within each state. Note that the borders of the states were not all the same as today. The label for each state also tells you the date that the state ratified the Constitution. <br><br>
Look at New York. How is it possible for a state that appears mostly against the Constitution to ratify it? Focus on the section of New York that is blue. The population living in that area was much higher, so more votes came from there.</p>
