<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Communities are all different. They differ in size, such as cities, states, and nations. They have different needs and concerns. When voters examine candidates for office, they are looking for someone to represent them and their community well.</p>
<p>Imagine you and your partners work as part of a community team. You were asked to write a job description for the top elected official in your community. You will determine what a person running for this office needs to know and be able to do. Your team will research and consider needs specific to your shared community.</p>

<h3>Step One: Identify Your Community and Top Elected Official</h3>

<p>First, your team should identify the community you have in common. Do you all live in the same city? Perhaps you don't, but you do all live in the same state. On the other hand, maybe one of you is out of state so your community is the whole country. When you have figured out your team's community, then determine the top elected official at that level of government. The chart below should help you.</p> 
<table border="1" summary="Top of elected official">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th valign="top">Level of Government</th>
    <th valign="top">Top Elected Official</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Local (city or county)</td>
    <td valign="top">Mayor, County   Commissioner, Council Chairman (depends on location)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td valign="top">State</td>
    <td valign="top">Governor</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">National</td>
    <td valign="top">President</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For example, Jenny, Jessie, and Jason all live in Orlando, Florida. They are writing a job description for the mayor of Orlando. Billy, Mandy, and Jimmy are a group as well. However, Billy lives in Orlando while Mandy lives in Tampa. Jimmy lives in Miami. Yet they all live in the state of Florida. They are writing a job description for the governor of Florida.</p> 
 <h3>Step Two: Conduct Background Research</h3>
 
 <p>Each member of the team should work on finding information that answers the following questions. You can look for news articles about each item and read them carefully. You can talk with trusted adults to brainstorm this information as well. You can explore the government website appropriate to your community.</p>
 
 <ul>
   <li>What is the top elected leader responsible for in your community?</li>
   <li>What are the current issues people are concerned about in your community?</li>
   <li>What important events have happened recently in your community?</li>
   <li>What are the most common ways people work in your community? (For example, if most people in your community are farmers, you should note that.)</li>
   <li>Are the majority of people in your community young, or parents, or retired? Where do they spend their time? What does the community have that meets their needs? What more could the community provide?</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Step Three: Discuss the Community's Needs</h3>

<p>As a team, discuss the information you discovered about your community. Record the information in your <strong>Community Team Chart</strong>. Make sure each team member understands the community. Then make a list of qualities, skills, and experiences the top official should have to serve your community well.</p>

<h3>Step Four: Create the Job Description</h3>

<p>Create a presentation that explains the qualifications for candidates. (Qualifications are the skills, experiences, and qualities your team listed.) Be sure to explain why each skill, experience, or quality is important. Include information about your community in the presentation. Your team should agree on at least 10 qualifications.</p>
<p>You can choose your format. Imagine your team will present it at a community meeting. People interested in running in the election will be there. Example formats include slideshow, video, or brochure. Be creative and have team members include pictures that represent your community.</p>


<h3>Step Five: Submit to Instructor</h3>

<p>There are <strong>two parts</strong> to your work in the collaboration activity. View the Grading Rubrics before completing and submitting this activity.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1</strong> &mdash; Once your team's discussion, brainstorming, and citizen group presentation are complete, you are ready to submit your Collaboration Project to assessment <strong>S2 00 Collaboration Project Segment Two</strong>. Be sure to include</p>

<ul>
<li>Advisory Team Research Chart</li>
<li>Advisory Team Presentation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Part 2</strong> &mdash; The Collaboration Assessment Guide is where you plan, reflect on, and share your experiences of working with your team. After you have completed the collaboration activity, submit the completed Collaboration Assessment Guide to assessment <strong>S2 00 Collaboration Assessment Guide Segment Two</strong>.
