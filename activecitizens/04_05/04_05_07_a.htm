<h2>Supreme Court Case Text Version</h2>
<h3>Does the First Amendment Protect Students in School?</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Imagine you are a justice on the Supreme Court! Today you will analyze two real Supreme Court cases related to freedom of expression in school. You will learn the background of each case and make your own decisions based on what you know about the First Amendment, just like a real Supreme Court justice!</p>
<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>First, you will hear the case of <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</em>, often shortened to <em>Tinker v. Des Moines</em>.</p>
<p>In 1965, a community group in Des Moines, Iowa held a protest against the Vietnam War. As part of the protest, people wore black armbands with peace symbols on them. Several students decided they would wear the armbands to school.</p>
<p>Is an action, like wearing an armband as an act of protest, a type of speech?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>No, speech only refers to language spoken aloud by people. <strong>Continue to Choice 1A Result, Scenario 2.</strong></li>
  <li>Yes, actions can express ideas and therefore is a type of speech. <strong>Skip to Choice 1B Result, Scenario 2.</strong></li>
</ol>  
<h4>Choice 1A Result, Scenario 2</h4>
<p>Oops, you are in the minority on this judgment. Most of the justices say that actions and symbols can express ideas, beliefs, and opinions. Actions and symbols that express meaning are a form of speech. For example, if you wear a baseball cap for a certain sports team, you are expressing that you support that team. Applauding or booing at the end of a performance expresses your approval or disapproval for the performers. Drawing hearts around someone’s picture shows you care about that person very much. Actions and symbols express meaning to others, even though you did not speak a word.</p>
<p>Now that you and the other justices have settled the question of symbolic speech, back to the case. The school board in Des Moines passed a rule against wearing the armbands. Several students, including Mary Beth and John Tinker, chose to wear the armbands anyway. Their schools banned them from attending school as punishment for breaking the rule. The Tinkers and their parents argue that the students have the right to wear the armbands as an act of free speech. The school board argues that the rule is necessary to prevent school disruption in schools caused by students debating or arguing about the war.</p>
<p>Do the Tinkers have the right to wear the arm bands to school under the First Amendment?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Yes, the First Amendment protects the Tinkers’ right to wear arm bands and other forms of free speech in public schools. <strong>Skip to Choice 2A Result, Scenario 3.</strong></li>
  <li>No, the First Amendment does not protect the Tinker’s wearing of arm bands and other forms of free speech in public schools. <strong>Skip to Choice 2B Result, Scenario 3.</strong></li>
</ol>  
<h4>Choice 1B Result, Scenario 2</h4>
<p>The majority of justices agree with you! Most of the justices say that actions and symbols can express ideas, beliefs, and opinions. Actions and symbols that express meaning are a form of speech. For example, if you wear a baseball cap for a certain sports team, you are expressing that you support that team. Applauding or booing at the end of a performance expresses your approval or disapproval for the performers. Drawing hearts around someone’s picture shows you care about that person very much.

The Tinkers and their parents argue that the students have the right to wear the armbands as an act of free speech. The school board argues that the rule is necessary to prevent school disruption in schools caused by students debating or arguing about the war.</p>
<p>Do the Tinkers have the right to wear the arm bands to school under the First Amendment?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Yes, the First Amendment protects the Tinkers’ right to wear arm bands and other forms of free speech in public schools. <strong>Continue to Choice 2A Result, Scenario 3.</strong></li>
  <li>No, the First Amendment does not protect the Tinker’s wearing of arm bands and other forms of free speech in public schools. <strong>Skip to Choice 2B Result, Scenario 3.</strong></li>
</ol>  
<h4>Choice 2A Result, Scenario 3</h4>
<p>The majority of justices agree with you! In writing the decision in the <em>Tinker </em>case, Justice Abe Fortas wrote, &quot;It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.&quot; The majority of justices on the case believe that the Constitution also protects the rights of students while in school. However, remember that rights may be limited in order to protect safety and the rights of others. The majority of justices said that schools have the right to make rules limiting freedom of speech if the speech disrupts the school and other students’ right to an education. </p>
<p>The school board argues that they passed the rule against the armbands to prevent violence between students. It pointed out that outside of school property, some students made angry remarks to those wearing armbands. The Tinkers and their parents argue that the wearing of armbands is a silent act expressing an opinion. The students did not plan any actions that would stop teachers from teaching or students from attending classes and other activities. No evidence was presented in court to prove that students made angry remarks or threats to each other on school property as a result of the armbands being worn.</p>
<p>Did the students’ choice to wear the armbands significantly disrupt classrooms and other students’ right to learn?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Yes, the armbands were a significant disruption. The school board’s ban is a reasonable limit on freedom of speech. <strong>Skip to Choice 3A Result.</strong></li>
  <li>No, the armbands did not cause significant disruption. The school board’s ban is an unreasonable limit on freedom of speech. <strong>Skip to Choice 3B Result.</strong></li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h4>Choice 3A Result</h4>
<p>You are in the minority on this judgment. In 1969, the majority of justices in the case of <em>Tinker v. Des Moines </em>agreed that the school board failed to prove that the armbands were disruptive. Therefore, the Supreme Court found in favor of the Tinkers. It ruled that symbolic speech is protected under the Constitution, that students have the right to free speech in school, and that the wearing of armbands were not a significant disruption. Note, however, that it did preserve the right of schools to make rules to limit the right of free speech in situations where the speech would be disruptive. This is important to protect the right of all students to an education.</p>
<p>Congratulations on completing your first case! Make sure you are taking careful notes and then proceed to tackle the next case on your schedule. <strong>Skip to Scenario 4.</strong></p>

<h4>Scenario 4</h4>
<p>Now it’s time for your next case. You will hear the case of <em>Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier</em>, often shortened to <em>Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier</em>.</p>
<p>In 1983, students in a journalism class at Hazelwood East High School prepared the next edition of their student newspaper. Their advisor brought a sample copy to the principal. He had to approve the final content of any work published by the school. The principal had concerns about two of the articles. Without enough time to have students redo the paper before the print deadline, he had it printed without the pages where the articles were supposed to appear. This action deleted two other articles as well. The students whose articles were not published were upset and took their case to court. </p>
<p>Is a school-sponsored newspaper a place for students to express their personal ideas and opinions?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>No, a student newspaper sponsored by the school is not a place for free student expression. <strong>Continue to Choice 4A Result, Scenario 5.</strong></li>
  <li>Yes, a student newspaper sponsored by the school is a place for free student expression. <strong>Skip to Choice 4B Result, Scenario 5.</strong></li>
</ol>  
<h4>Choice 4A Result, Scenario 5</h4>
<p>The majority of justices agree with you! Since the student newspaper is produced as part of the school’s instruction, it technically belongs to the school. The students work on the paper as part of their grade in journalism class. A teacher assists the students with work on the newspaper. The school gives its name, time, materials, and other resources needed to produce the paper. </p>
<p>The principal believes he had the right to censor the material because it was the school’s paper. He thought two of the articles were inappropriate for students in the school. The articles had personal information about students and parents, and he does not feel the articles protected their identities enough. The students in the journalism class insist that this was a violation of their right to freedom of the press, a form of speech through publication. They also say that not having a chance to change the articles and avoid deletion was unfair.</p>
<p>Does the students’ right to freedom of expression require the school to allow printing of information that it finds inappropriate?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Yes, just like in the <em>Tinker </em>decision, students have the right to free expression in school. The school cannot censor the ideas and opinions of the students. <strong>Choice 5A result.</strong></li>
  <li>No, the school has the right to censor material that may be inappropriate for the students. This is a reasonable limit to freedom of expression under the <em>Tinker </em>decision. <strong>Choice 5B result.</strong></li>
</ol>

</ol>  
<h4>Choice 5A Result</h4>
<p>Oops, you are in the minority on this judgment. In 1988, the Supreme Court found in favor of Hazelwood School District. The majority of justices agree that the principal was right to censor the material. The principal had concerns about the material. He was concerned about the privacy of the students who wrote or gave interviews for the articles. Because the school’s name would appear on the paper and the school used its resources to print the paper, the principal has the final say on the content of the newspaper. The students did not have the right to make final decisions about content. The principal chose to censor the paper in the best interest of the other students and the school. </p>
<p>Congratulations! You have completed your work for the day. Thank you for your careful decisions in the cases of <em>Tinker v. Des Moines</em> and <em>Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier.</em></p>
