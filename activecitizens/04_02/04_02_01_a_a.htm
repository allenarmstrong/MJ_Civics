  <li>Under California law, a person was sent to jail for 50 years up to a life sentence for being caught stealing three times. <strong>Yes</strong><br><br>
  <strong><em>Case of Lockyer v. Andrade</em> (2003)</strong><br>
The Supreme Court ruled that the California "three strikes" law was constitutional. This law requires the state court to give a much longer jail or prison sentence to those who are convicted of serious crimes three or more times.

</li>
