<h2>Laws: Answers Text Version</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>The officer and Brian meet again! Help Brian choose how to respond to the officer’s questions.</p>
  <p>Officer: Hello again, Brian. I trust that you are aware of the time. It is quite close to curfew.</p>
  <h4>Question 1</h4>
  <p>How should Brian respond?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Of course. I found in our local newspaper that we now have a curfew of 10 p.m., passed by our city council. I may not agree with it, but it is law so I must follow it. </li>
    <li>Of course. However, the Constitution does not mention any curfew, so I don’t think I have to follow a local curfew law.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Feedback for #1—Great response!</strong><br>You know how to learn about local laws.</p>
   <p><strong>Feedback for #2—Oops!</strong><br>State and local governments may pass laws that do not conflict with the Constitution. The Constitution may not mention curfews, but that does not mean that the city cannot approve a curfew. Try again.</p>
    <p>[Officer] You make a good point. How does a teen like you know so much about the effects of laws?</p>
  <h4>Question 2</h4>
<p>How should Brian respond?</p>
   <ol>
   <li>I learn about laws only from you, my classes, and my parents. I have no other reliable source of information.</li>
   <li>I learned that I can find information about laws at all levels of government—local, state, and federal. Web sites have information on past laws, present laws, even bills under debate. I can learn what people think about them through the media.</li>
   </ol>
    <p><strong>Feedback for #1—Oops!</strong><br>Government web sites will give you basic information about laws. You can learn to analyze people’s viewpoints in print, on television, and online. Try again.</p>
    <p><strong>Feedback for #2—Great response!</strong><br>
    You have learned how to be an informed citizen on the effects of laws.</p>
 <p>[Officer] I am glad you have learned so much. Head on home and have a great night!</p>
