  <h1 class="latitle">How the Electoral College Works</h1>
  <p align="left">From the popular vote totals in the 2000 presidential election, most would assume that Al Gore had won the election. However, the popular vote is not all that counts when choosing the next president of the United States.</p>
<p>The candidate who gets the most votes from the citizens of the United States may, or may not, become the next president. Hereâ€™s why: The President of the United States is chosen through a system called the electoral college. It is the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes that becomes the president-elect. In the 2000 presidential election George Bush received 271 electoral votes and Al Gore received 266, making George Bush the winner.</p>
  <h2>So what is an electoral college?</h2>
  <p>An electoral college is a group of people who are chosen to select a candidate for a particular office. In the United States we only use this system for selecting the president. Other office holders who are elected win by popular vote. </p>
  <p>When citizens of the United States go to the polls in November every four years, they are actually voting for members of the electoral college who will cast their ballot for the next president. Following the general election, the chosen electors hold a meeting, usually in the state capital, where they officially cast their ballots for the next president and vice-president. These ballots are sent to Congress where the ballots are counted. Once a candidate receives a majority of the votes, he or she is declared the winner.</p>
