  <p class="text"><strong>Scuba diver in a tree – hoax? </strong></p>
  <p class="text">Early last year firefighters battled raging flames in northern California, as nearly a third of national forest burned to the ground. After weeks of round-the-clock efforts, the firefighters finally contained the deadly flames and saved the rest of the trees and habitats. </p>
  <p class="text">California residents were relieved, and relief efforts to clean up and restore the damaged forest began nearly immediately. </p>
  <p class="text">Imagine the surprise and confusion when one of the cleanup volunteers found the charred remains of a scuba diver – wearing full scuba gear –  in one of the blackened branches of a sycamore tree! </p>
  <p class="text">How did this happen?</p>
   <p class="text">Authorities puzzled over the mystery for several days before they identified the body as that of a world-renowned scuba diver. He had been diving off the California coast during the raging fire, but he had not entered the woods to anyone’s knowledge. </p>
   <p class="text">Finally, investigations showed that the diver had been caught in a bucket as fire-fighting helicopters pulled water from the ocean to put out the flames. One moment the diver was enjoying his favorite pastime, and the next he was being dropped into a burning tree!</p>
   <p class="text">At first glance, this email seems realistic – and shocking. That is a common combination for an urban legend. The original writer hopes that you will fall for the joke and pass it along. </p>
   <p class="text">In order to determine whether this particular legend was truth or fiction, we called authorities throughout northern California to ask whether there are any existing reports of such a thing taking place… </p>

  <p class="text"><strong>NO. The scuba diver did not burn in a tree</strong></p>
  <p class="text">I’m really tired of people calling me to ask whether such a thing could have happened. Here’s the story: a scuba diver, out for a swim, gets picked up by a helicopter bucket and dumped into a forest fire, where he burns to death. The helicopter pilot was trying to get water to put out the fire, and he or she didn’t notice a scuba diver in the waters below. Freak accident.</p>
  <p class="text">Well, it’s a great story, but it’s not true. I’m not saying that a helicopter pilot would always see every single person who’s swimming around in the water. But as the distributor of those buckets that are used to put out forest fires, I can tell you that no human being can fit inside of them. It simply is not possible. Please quit calling my office to ask whether my products are safe. </p>
