<h2>Grocery Store Text Version</h2>
<p>Welcome to Concord Grocery! You have chosen the best store for all your grape-related (and other food) needs! Today we have tables set up outside the store. Volunteers for each mayoral candidate are sharing information with voters. Before you visit the tables, let&rsquo;s see how voters evaluate candidates for office!</p>
<h3>Evaluating Candidates </h3>
<p>Order these items by arranging them in order from what is most important at the top of the list to least important at the bottom of the list, in your opinion, when evaluating a candidate. The items appear in alphabetical order. <strong>Note</strong>: There are no right or wrong answers.</p>
<h4>Categories</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Appearance</li>
  <li>Background and education</li>
  <li>Family</li>
  <li>Issue positions</li>
  <li>Personality and character</li>
  <li>Political party membership</li>
  <li>Social group memberships</li>
  <li> Work experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Each person can have a different opinion on what is most important about a person seeking office. Many other factors exist that are not on this survey, such as the ability to speak a foreign language or to stay calm during a crisis. Surveys from over 70 years ago showed that voters thought political party membership was most important, followed by social group memberships, personality, and position on issues. However, while those are still the top four categories, the order has reversed. Today, most Americans regard personality and issue positions as the top factor in choosing a candidate. What has changed? Many people believe the change in order is because of the expansion of the media. We now have instant ability to hear and see candidates through the television and Internet. People have more access than ever before to the media. They can make judgments on candidates based on what they say and how they act. Voters do not have to rely on knowing the candidates&rsquo; political parties to understand their positions on issues. They can hear and read it for themselves.</p>
<h3>Visit the Tables </h3>
<p>There are four tables, each decorated for a particular candidate and with a donation jar.. At each table, you can hear a pitch for the candidate.</p>
<p>Be sure to visit each table to learn about each candidate. The flyer you receive tells you about the candidate&rsquo;s qualifications, experience, and goals for our city. Remember to take notes now to help you vote in the election!</p>

<h3>Evaluate the Candidates</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Why do volunteer campaign workers seek donations and conduct fundraisers for their candidates?  </li>
  

  <ul>
    <li>They want payment for the time they are assisting the campaign.</li>
    <li>Candidates have to quit their jobs while they are campaigning.</li>
    <li>Running a campaign is expensive, especially to use the media.</li>
    <li>People have to pay a large fee to be a candidate for office.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Which candidate table focused the least on campaign donations?</li>

  <ul>
    <li>David Democrat</li>
    <li>Elaine Environs</li>
    <li>Norman No-Tax</li>
    <li>Rita Republican</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Why might an incumbent candidate, the candidate currently serving in the office and running for re-election, worry less than the others about raising campaign funds?</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Incumbent candidates have no chance of winning the election, so they have no need to raise as much money as others.</li>
    <li>The candidate who runs as the incumbent receives a large sum of money from the local government to run the campaign.</li>
    <li>A person has to have a great deal of personal wealth to become an incumbent candidate so they do not need donations.</li>
    <li>Voters are already familiar with the incumbent, so less money is needed for materials that give voters this basic information.</li>
