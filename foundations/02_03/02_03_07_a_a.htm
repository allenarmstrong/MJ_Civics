			<p>You may use a dictionary or visit the <a class="pop" href="http://library.flvs.net/" title="FLVS Virtual Library">Virtual Library</a> to help you with new words. In addition, you may wish to review the parts of the Declaration of Independence first. A copy is in your CAP file. Knowing the section that a quote is from will help you determine meaning.</p>
<h3>Quote 1</h3>
<p>&ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Question 1</h4>
<p>What does &ldquo;self-evident&rdquo; mean?</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> Meaningless to anyone but the writer</li>
  <li><strong>Obvious without explanation or proof</strong></li>
  <li>Clear only to those writing the document</li>
  <li>Requiring evidence to prove a certain truth</li>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—The colonists were saying that their ideas are obvious and true to everyone.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Question 2</h4>
<p>What are the &ldquo;unalienable rights&rdquo;?</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong>Natural rights that people have at birth and cannot be taken away</strong></li>
  <li>Natural rights that only people from other countries may have</li>
  <li>Rights that are taken away if a person is classified as an alien</li>
  <li>Rights that cannot be given to people who are aliens</li>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—Unalienable rights are the natural rights that John Locke said people had at birth. Government could not take them away. The colonists make the case in the middle section of the Declaration of Independence that the king tried to take away their natural rights. This was a main reason for writing the document.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Question 3</h4>
<p>Which of the following lists the &ldquo;unalienable rights&rdquo; as they appear in the Declaration of Independence?</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Making war, starting a rebellion, and purchasing land</li>
  <li>Holding meetings, making grievances, and quartering troops</li>
  <li>Self-evident, natural rights, and created equal</li>
  <li><strong>Life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness</strong></li>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—The quote says that men have &ldquo;certain unalienable Rights,&rdquo; and the next few words are &ldquo;that among these.&rdquo; Therefore, the next few words will be some of the &ldquo;unalienable rights.&rdquo; The quote lists &ldquo;Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.&rdquo; In other words, people are born with the right to live, to be free, and to make their own choices about how to live their lives. The colonists were saying that government could not take these away.</p>
</ol>
<h3>Quote 2</h3>
<p>&ldquo;That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Question 4</h4>
<p>What does &ldquo;instituted&rdquo; mean?</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Forcing something onto people</li>
  <li>Continued from past practices</li>
  <li><strong>Set something up, create</strong></li>
  <li>Discussed as a possibility</li>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—&ldquo;Instituted&rdquo; means to set something up or create something. Here the colonists are saying that the purpose of government, or the reason people create government, is to protect people&rsquo;s rights.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Question 5</h4>
<p>What does the &ldquo;consent of the governed&rdquo; mean?</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong>Agreement and permission of the people</strong></li>
  <li>Acceptance of those without any power</li>
  <li>Arguments against the government</li>
  <li>Authority of government leaders</li>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—&ldquo;Consent&rdquo; means to agree or give permission for something. &ldquo;The governed&rdquo; are the people who live under a certain government and must follow its rules. Here the colonists are saying that governments exist and have their powers only because the people agree, or consent, to it. This is part of the idea of the social contract.</p>
</ol>
<h3>Quote 3</h3>
<p>&ldquo;For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Question 6</h4>

<ol type="a">
  <li> a statement of belief</li>
  <li>from the formal declaration </li>
  <li><strong>one grievance against the king</strong></li>
  <li>an idea about purpose of government</li>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—The middle section of the Declaration of Independence contains the specific grievances against King George III. In this quote, the colonists are complaining about the quartering of troops.</p>
</ol>
<h4>Question 7</h4>
<p>What is meant by &ldquo;quartering&rdquo; in this quote?</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Testing and training </li>
  <li>Giving defense equipment</li>
  <li>Dividing into four sections</li>
  <li><strong>Providing living or sleeping space</strong></li>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—&ldquo;Quartering&rdquo; troops refers to making arrangements for living or sleeping. The colonists were angry that Britain forced them to allow British soldiers to stay in their homes and barns. The soldiers carried weapons with them and stayed in the colonies for years after the end of the French and Indian War. Many colonists felt threatened by their presence.</p>
</ol>
<h3>Quote 4</h3>
<p>&ldquo;He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Question 8</h4>

<ol type="a">
  <li>Allowed</li>
  <li>Ordered </li>
  <li><strong>Not permitted</strong></li>
  <li>Not prevented</li>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—&ldquo;Forbidden&rdquo; means not permitted, or disallowed. The colonists here are upset that the king has not allowed the governors of the colonies to pass laws the colonists thought were important. He prevented the colonists and governors from taking care of local issues on their own.</p>
</ol>
<h3>Quote 5</h3>
<p>&ldquo;For protecting them (British soldiers), by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:&rdquo;</p>

  <li>The king protected soldiers from the colonists by bringing them back to Britain.</li>
  <li>The king ordered soldiers to murder colonists who made fun of jury trials.</li>
  <li><strong>The king did not punish British soldiers who attacked the colonists.</strong></li>
  <li>The king sent soldiers to hold trials against disloyal colonists.</li>
  <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—The colonists were upset that British officers involved in the fighting at Lexington and Concord were sent to Britain for questioning and trial. The colonists call it a &ldquo;mock Trial&rdquo; because they said the king had no intention to punish any soldiers, who they believed were responsible for the battles. The colonists saw the deaths of the colonists in Massachusetts as murder because the soldiers were supposed to be there for protection of the colonies.</p>
</ol>
<h3>Quote 6</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Question 10</h4>
<p>Which of the following statements is the best explanation of this quote?</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Every time we sent a letter to the king, he had his soldiers attack us in order to keep us quiet. He should no longer be a king.</li>
    <li>Our problems should have been resolved without us having to send petitions. The prince, the king&rsquo;s son, should immediately replace the king as ruler of Britain and these colonies.</li>
    <li>Our people have showed the wrongs of the king by putting on stage plays throughout the colonies. Everyone in all of the colonies agrees that we should break away as soon as possible.</li>
    <li><strong>We have tried to speak to King George III about our concerns several times. Every time we sent a petition, the king ignored and insulted us. A ruler, who acts like a tyrant, or abuses power, should not be a leader of free people like us.</strong></li>
    <p><strong>Feedback</strong>—The colonists here are explaining that they contacted the king many times with their complaints. King George III did not respond to their petitions. They were insulted that he would ignore them and that he did not try to make up for their troubles. To the colonists, this made the king a tyrant, a leader who abuses power. They are saying that tyrants have no right to rule free people.</p>
