<h2>Competition Text Version</h2>

<p>Something else that affects price in a market is competition. Suppose there were only one pizza parlor in town. The owner might be able to charge a lot more for a pizza than it costs to make since he is the only supplier. But, if another pizza parlor were to open down the street, he couldn't raise his prices very much without the risk of losing his customers to the competition. Competition ensures that prices are kept close to the cost of production. Competition forces sellers to compete not only in price but in service and quality. A better-tasting pizza attracts more customers.</p>
