 					<node><![CDATA[Alicia: Hmm… I need to have something on my teacher's desk by 2 o'clock today so that they can prepare it for the morning student news. Thankfully, I have already researched the student government elections for a good story and can draft the story quickly.<br><br>I heard a story the other day that I think you might want to consider putting on the school news tomorrow morning. It's pretty amazing!<br><br>I wonder what the story is about. ... <br><br>Early last year firefighters battled raging flames in northern California, as nearly a third of our beloved national forest burned to the ground.<br>After weeks of round-the-clock efforts, the firefighters finally contained the deadly flames and saved the rest of the trees and habitats.<br>California residents were thrilled, and a relief effort began nearly immediately to clean up and restore the damaged forest. Imagine the surprise and confusion when one of the cleanup volunteers (a graduate from our high school) found the charred remains of a scuba diver—wearing full scuba gear—in one of the blackened branches of a sycamore tree!<br><br>How did this happen?<br><br>Authorities puzzled over the mystery for several days before they identified the body as that of a world-renowned scuba diver. He had been diving off the California coast during the raging fire, but he had not entered the woods to anyone's knowledge.<br><br>Finally, investigations showed that the diver had been caught in a bucket as fire-fighting helicopters pulled water from the ocean to put out the flames. One moment the diver was enjoying his favorite pastime, and the next he was being dropped onto a burning tree!<br><br>This scuba diver piece that Paul sent me is pretty interesting! It also involves a graduate from our school. Maybe I should turn in a news story about this as well!<br><br>Select Next to continue.]]></node>
					<node><![CDATA[What should Alicia do now?<br><br>Select the correct option.<br><br>This is a good plan! In order to be a good reporter, Alicia needs to find the facts about anything she wants to put on air. This story about the scuba diver is definitely interesting, but how much of it is true? Before she can turn in her work, Alicia needs to do some research.<br><br>Are you wondering who I am? Well, I am Mike, a librarian by profession. As a librarian, very often I face a lot of questions from students looking for specific information. So, I'd like to take this opportunity to guide you on how to perform an effective search for reliable information.<br><br>Select Next to continue.]]></node>

		 <transcript>
		<node><![CDATA[Once a researcher has identified a strong research question—or series of research questions—it is time to do some preliminary research. This allows you to find basic information that will help guide you in your future searches.<br><br>Remember that you must stay focused when doing research online; simply use this time to explore what is out there about your research questions. Don’t visit web sites that might be inappropriate or unrelated to your topic and never enter or post your private information.<br><br>Search engines and online directories are excellent tools to help you begin your research. Select each tool for more information. Start by searching for the key words and subject headings that you identified in Step 1.<br><br>To make sure you find the most useful information, you may want to explore various searching methods. One common method is known as Boolean logic. Most search engines and online directories will support Boolean searching.<br><br>Here are some examples of how it works. Select each option to learn how it works. Try it out for yourself to see how it can help you!<br><br>Some search engines will use slightly different commands from those you might be used to using. If you don't find what you're looking for, try a combination of key terms and search commands.<br><br>If you want to find a web site that covers both dogs and cats in the same article, you might search by typing in dogs AND cats. Select the Close button to continue.<br><br>If you don't mind whether you find information about dogs or cats, you might search by typing in dogs OR cats. The search engine provides you with the results of web pages that have information either about cats or dogs or both.<br><br>Select the Close button to continue.<br><br>If you want to find an article online about dogs and cats, but not about stores that carry dogs and cats, you might search by typing in dogs AND cats NOT stores. The search engine provides you with the results of web pages that have information about both cats and dogs.  At the same time, the search engine eliminates web pages about stores carrying cats and dogs.<br><br>Select the Close button to continue.<br><br>One potential problem with search engines and online databases or directories is that they will normally search for the exact terms you enter. The good news is most search engines are not case-sensitive for your search topics. However, use capital letters when using Boolean terms. Not all sites require it, but it is a good habit to have when you use certain search engines.<br>Be sure you spell your words properly and enter several synonyms, just in case! Truncation can help with this issue.<br><br>The common truncation method is to use an asterisk to indicate that you are looking for words with those letters at the beginning. For example, if you were searching for the word 'joyful,' you could type joy* into a search bar, and that would locate words such as 'joy,' 'joyful,' and 'joyous.' This can be a very helpful technique when you are performing preliminary research.<br><br>Have you ever played the “Operator” game, where one person whispers a phrase to another person, and that person whispers it to another person, and so on? By the end of the line, the phrase has often changed significantly. Good research includes verifying the accuracy of sources. Primary sources provide firsthand accounts and archival evidence of events. Secondary sources, such as biographies and research done long after the event occurred, can also be great sources of clues. Select each type of source for more information.<br><br>Select Next to continue.]]></node>

		 <transcript>
		<node><![CDATA[Having completed the first two steps, it is time to evaluate the online sources and the information gathered.<br><br>Not all sources are credible, and in order to be a good researcher, you must learn how to find the right information for your task. One important question to ask yourself is whether the site you have found is written or maintained by someone who is an authority on the topic. If the answer is no, or if you can't find out, then it is better to search for another source instead. Even if the information looks valid, it is not considered credible until an established authority supports it.<br><br>What makes someone an authority on a topic? Many different people can lend credibility to your search:<br>People whose job it is to study and report on this topic,<br>People who have experienced your topic first-hand,<br>People who work for organizations that deal with this topic,<br>Companies or organizations that focus on this topic,<br>Most universities and newspapers.<br><br>You should look for four main points while evaluating an online source. They are:<br>Does the web site express a specific opinion?<br>How recently was the web site published?<br>Is the author credible?<br>Does the web site provide documentation?<br>Select each question to learn more.<br><br>Remember: Wikis, as well as question boards, are often quite useful for preliminary research, however, they are not considered credible sources that you can use in your final data. This is because it is possible for any person to edit them at any time. In other words, be cautious of using some online encyclopedias where users can edit content. You wouldn't want to write about George Washington being the 55th President of France. That is not credible information!<br><br>Select Next to continue. ]]></node>
					<node><![CDATA[Let's examine Alicia's preliminary research results to determine which sites are credible and which are not. Select the sources one at a time to examine each in detail. Then classify each with the up arrow if it is credible and you believe it can be trusted or a down arrow if it is not credible and you believe it should not be trusted.<br><br>With your preliminary research done, it is time to head to the library.<br><br>Your library is an excellent source of useful information that you can search in a variety of ways.<br><br>First of all, don't be afraid to ask questions! Remember to ask the librarian for help in finding any information you need.<br><br>Assisting others with locating the right books, magazines, journals, newspapers, and more is part of the job, and you may find many new and useful ways to carry out your research simply by asking for advice.<br><br>A great online resource is the Ask a librarian web site, where you can go to request for useful information in a live chat session.<br><br>The library catalog organizes every item the library owns, as well as some that the library can borrow from other locations. You can often search your library's catalog online as well as in the building itself.<br><br>Be sure to write down the call number of any books you are interested in checking out. This will help you find where the books are located when you begin searching the library shelves.<br><br>If you have some free time, you can also browse the stacks of books in the library corridors. Books are generally shelved according to subject, so once you locate your topic in the shelves, you can explore what is available.<br><br>Select Next to continue.]]></node>
