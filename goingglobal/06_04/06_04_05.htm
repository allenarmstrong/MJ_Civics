            <h2>1973 - Oil Crisis</h2> 
            <img src="images/06_04_05_a.jpg" width="300" height="196" alt="Oil Crisis - 1974" class="floatRight"><span class="captionFloatRight">&copy; 1973 AP Images</span>
            <p>In 1973, some of the most important oil-producing countries stopped exporting oil to the United States and other countries.</p>
            <p>The oil producers were upset with U.S. support to Israel. Israel was at war for territory. The drop in supply caused high prices and long lines at U.S. gas pumps. Stations had to place limits on the amount of gas people could buy. They often ran out. Other countries felt the effects too, especially those that supported U.S. policy in Israel. Some leaders began to distance themselves from the United States. U.S. leaders began working on removing itself from the Israel conflict at the same time that they worked on an agreement to start importing oil again.</p>

            <p>The central government of the United Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), or Soviet Union, dissolved into fifteen separate republics.</p>
            <p>The breakup ended a long tense period between the United States and the USSR known as the Cold War. For about 50 years, both countries were in greater competition with the other. Sometimes their actions lead to fear of nuclear war. Each new republic had to reorganize or establish a central government. It had to build relationships with other countries. Their economies collapsed during the changes. Years later, some countries were poorer than they were before the breakup. It had a negative effect on Cuba as well. It depended on the USSR for trade. Disagreements over territory and leadership continued for years. Many people left the confusion to live in other countries like the United States. People in some areas refused to accept the end of the USSR, prompting others to prepare to defend themselves, like the soldiers from Ukraine training in this image.</p>

            <p>A powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean created 30-foot tsunami waves that crashed on surrounding lands. It hit Indonesia the hardest. Experts estimate that between 200,000 
            and 300,000 people died. Even more went missing, were injured, or had to move because of the destruction.</p>
            <p>People, organizations, and governments around the world worked together to help those affected. Shipping, tourism, and fishing were all major industries affected by the tsunami. 
            Pollution of farmland from salt water and chemicals ruined many crops. Recovery for these countries will take years. The people will continue to need assistance in food and rebuilding.</p>

            <p>Japan experienced a nuclear power plant failure and release of radioactive chemicals following an earthquake. The country's leaders maintained it had control of the situation, while 
            people around the world grew more concerned.</p>
            <p>Prices for nuclear energy companies dropped, while prices rose for companies that produce renewable energy, such as solar. Public anti-nuclear energy reaction increased in many countries. 
            Some people became fearful of buying food and medicine products produced in Japan, fearful of contamination. People had to stop farming near the nuclear sites.</p>
