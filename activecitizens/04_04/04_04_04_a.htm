<h2>How the Amendments Protect Text Version</h2>
<h3>Fifth</h3>
<p>The Fifth Amendment protects the people's right to due process of law under the federal government. It says that government cannot force people to speak or provide evidence against themselves. It is the job of law enforcement to prove guilt by presenting evidence.  Remember, the courts presume people are innocent unless proven guilty. For serious crimes, like murder, this amendment says the government must prove to a grand jury that they have enough evidence to even bring an accused person to trial! The amendment also protects a person from double jeopardy, or going to trial for the same exact crime more than once.</p>
<h3>Sixth</h3>
<p>The Sixth Amendment protects the right of people to a speedy, public, and fair trial by jury. Suspects in crimes have the right to know the charges and evidence against them and to face their accusers. They have the right to have a group of people like themselves, rather than a single judge, consider all the facts of the case and decide whether the person is guilty or not. They have the right to present evidence in their own defense and to have the help of an attorney. The trial cannot be secret and the accused cannot be held for a long time without going to trial.</p>
<h3>Eighth</h3>
<p>The Eighth Amendment protects people from cruel or unusual punishments for crimes. It includes protection from bail or fines that are too high considering the crime.</p>
<h3>Fourteenth</h3>
<p>The Fourteenth Amendment gives all citizens equal protection of the laws. This means that all Americans have the same rights under the lawâ€”no matter what their background, gender, or race. The amendment extended responsibility for following due process to the state governments.  Just like the federal government, states must respect all of the legal rights owed to a person under the law and Constitution.</p>
