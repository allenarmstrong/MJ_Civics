<h2>Currency: Answers Text Version</h2>
<p>Exchange rates change daily. Use these sample rates to answer the questions that follow.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>U.S. Dollar = $1.00</li>
    <li>To get 1 U.S. dollar, you need 0.72 European Union euros.</li>
    <li>To get 1 U.S. dollar, you need 13 Mexican pesos.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Imagine you have five U.S. dollars and are visiting Mexico. You go to a currency exchange and ask for Mexican pesos. Since you get 13 pesos for every one U.S. dollar, you will get a total of 65 pesos for your money. (<strong>Why: </strong>5 times 13 equals 65.)</p>
<p>Imagine you come home from a bus tour of the European Union with 50 euros. You go to currency exchange and ask for U.S. dollars. Since you get 0.72 euros for every one U.S. dollar, you will get a total of 69.44 U.S. dollars. (<strong>Why: </strong>50 divided by 0.72 equals 69.44.)</p>
<ol>
<li>How many euros can you get for ten U.S. dollars?<br><strong>7.2 euros (10 times 0.72 equals 7.2.)</strong></li>
<li>How many pesos can you get for ten U.S. dollars?<br><strong>130 pesos (10 times 13 equals 130.)</strong></li>
<li>How many U.S. dollars can you get for 1000 pesos?<br><strong>76.92 dollars (1000 divided by 13 equals 76.92.)</strong></li>
<li>How many U.S. dollars can you get for 150 euros?<br><strong>208.33 dollars (150 divided by 0.72 equals 208.33.)</strong></li>
<li>If a dinner in Mexico costs 260 pesos, how much does it cost in U.S. dollars?<br><strong>20 dollars (260 divided by 13 equals 20.)</strong></li>
<li>If a dinner in France costs 18 euros, how much does it cost in U.S. dollars?<br><strong>25 dollars (18 divided by 0.72 equals 25.)</strong></li>
<li>Assume the dinner was the same in both countries. Which has the better deal for an American visitor?<br><strong>Mexico</strong></li>
