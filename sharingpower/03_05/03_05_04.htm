<h1>How Can the Rule of Law Affect Other Levels of Government?</h1>
<p><span class="tooltip">Rule of Law<span><strong>Rule of Law:</strong> the principle that both those who govern and those who are governed must obey the law and are subject to the same laws</span></span> applies to all levels of government. This means that all government officials must follow laws and other rules that apply to them. Education is a great area to study the debates and effects of laws on different levels of governments. In 1983, the U.S. Department of Education issued the report A Nation at Risk. It called on the states to have higher expectations of students and to make changes to support them. It was not the first report of its kind, and other reports followed that challenged its conclusions.</p>
<p>Most Americans agree that education is important to the future of society. Students need certain skills to one day have a job and be informed citizens. Yet not all Americans agree on what the most important skills are or the best ways for students to learn them. Since that 1983 report, many changes have taken place at all levels of government to improve the quality of American education. Some changes are new. Others <span class="tooltip">amend<span><strong>Amend:</strong> to make a change to improve or correct something</span></span> prior laws or programs.</p>
<p>Sometimes laws are put into place to organize programs or regulate procedures. View this slideshow to see how one federal program that was passed into law in 2009 has affected different levels of government and Americans' ideas about education.</p>

            <p>Race to the Top (RTTP for short) is a grant program approved by Congress and run by the U.S. Department of Education. Congress passed it as part of a very large group of bills that became the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In the RTTP program, states competed for additional money to support changes to their education system. They submitted applications explaining the changes they were making and planned to make with the money. The applications were scored based on each state's focus on these criteria:
<ul>
	<li>improving the quality of what students are taught</li>
	<li>improving the quality of tests to measure student learning</li>
	<li>improving the collection and use of data (like student scores on tests)</li>
	<li>increasing teacher and principal effectiveness</li>
	<li>improving the schools struggling the most</li>
</ul>

            </div>
            <p>States had to meet certain rules to apply and they could improve their application scores by making certain changes. For example, applying states could have no laws or other barriers to connecting student scores to individual teachers and principals. In other words, it must be possible to see not only what a particular student's scores are, but who his or her teachers are.</p><p>Teachers and principals with students who perform well or show great learning gains could be rewarded. Some worry that by tying student scores to specific staff, if the students do not do well then those staff could lose their jobs. Some states, like Massachusetts and Illinois, changed laws to give parents more choice in how and where to educate their children. These states made changes that would not only affect local communities, but also improve their application scores.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Effects on local governments could include building new schools or increasing funding to school boards for specific projects. For example, a school might receive money to start a special program aimed at increasing its students' reading and math scores. </p><p>The call for improving what students learn affects local classrooms. Teachers may create new lessons and use different books and other tools.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Most bills never make it to a vote, never become law. About 10% do become law at the federal level. We see that the laws that are passed can still provoke debate. The U.S. Constitution creates a system where all views can be heard in the lawmaking process. </p><p>Laws can affect citizens across the nation and governments at every level. </p><p>Laws can change based on new ideas and experiences from past laws. Race to the Top is one example of many programs approved in law that affected many people, communities, and governments. This particular program was a choice. States did not have to participate. Most laws require or prohibit certain actions.</p>
