<h2>News Station Text Version</h2>
<p><strong><em>Reporter Stew Preserves:</em></strong> Welcome to the News Station! We have two offices here—our newspaper, The Grape Press, and our TV studio, Concord TV. Candidates use all forms of media to reach voters. Examples include television, newspapers, and the Internet. Most Americans get the news from TV. However, the Internet is great for campaigns because of its relatively low cost and high speed. Thousands or even millions of people can read a message posted on the Internet within minutes. On the other hand, the scripts for television are prepared and edited long before broadcast. TV and newspapers often have websites to stay competitive, publishing bits of news as soon as it is available. You can see the candidates&rsquo; websites at the Concord Library. Here we will examine the advertisements they place on TV and in the newspaper. Remember to take notes now to help you in the election later!</p>
<p>To be an informed voter, you need to learn how to view these ads with a critical eye. Advertisements, whether for a candidate or a product, are trying to convince you to do something. Creators of ads have specific characteristics that make them persuasive. If you are aware of these characteristics, you can understand the purpose of the ad. You can determine whether it makes a claim with which you either agree or disagree. Advertisements show bias (preference toward a particular belief or attitude), often use symbols (something, such as a picture, that represents something else), and are propaganda (information that an organization or government sends out to promote a policy, idea, or cause).</p>

    <td valign="top">Explanation</td>
    <td valign="top">A political   advertisement has bias because the maker shows preference toward a particular   belief or attitude.</td>
    <td valign="top">Symbols are images or   text in advertisements that represent something else or have a meaning not   obvious from the picture itself.</td>
    <td valign="top">Propaganda is   information an organization or government sends out to promote a policy, idea,   or cause. An advertisement is a type of propaganda. Many people think of the   word &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; as something bad, but its original meaning is neutral.   Propaganda can promote both popular and unpopular ideas.</td>

    <td valign="top">Examples</td>
    <td valign="top">An ad for Rita   Republican shows a bias toward her plans for Concord City.</p>
      <p>An ad that points out   Norman No-Tax&rsquo;s lack of political experience shows a bias toward candidates   serving in elected positions.</td>
    <td valign="top">Donkeys on David   Democrat&rsquo;s website are symbols for the Democratic Party, of which he is a   member.</p>
      <p>Candidate ads that   use an American flag are trying to convince viewers that the candidate is   proud of his or her country.</td>
    <td valign="top">All candidate   advertisements, including websites, are examples of propaganda. People   responsible for the campaigns or the candidates themselves create the   advertisements to promote themselves as the best person for office. </td>

They see the word &ldquo;your&rdquo; emphasized. The   words and arrangement make people feel they have been wronged, that their   rights were violated. It uses a propaganda technique called &ldquo;loaded words.&rdquo;   Saying that non-farmers in office are &ldquo;useless&rdquo; is designed to make voters   feel negative about the other candidates.</td>

<h3>Print Ads</h3>
<p>Propaganda can appear in print as well. View each page of this newspaper to see different examples of political ads. How are these different from the television advertisements?</p>
<h4>Page 1 (front page) of Newspaper</h4>
  <p><em>Title of newspaper </em>The Grape Press<br>
  <em>Biggest headline: </em>Campaigns Heat Up—Debate Tonight at City Hall!<br>
  <em>Other headline: &ldquo;</em>No Rain in Forecast, Vines Dying&rdquo;<br>
  <em>Advertisement description: Shows David Democrat with grimace in black and white next to Rita Republican smiling in color Text of ad says, &ldquo;</em>David Democrat says he&rsquo;s for the children, but he voted against increasing school funding last month. Our kids need technology to compete in business. Keep Rita in office on Election Day. She knows what kids really need.&rdquo;<br>
  I<em>nformation for ad: </em>The ad uses black and white and a non-flattering photo of David Democrat to make him look unpleasant. Rita appears in color and smiling to send a positive message about her. Viewers know that either Rita or a group that supports her paid for the ad. The ad uses a propaganda technique called &ldquo;selective facts.&rdquo; It states that David voted against increasing funding, but does not state why. Perhaps there was a good reason he voted against it. The ad also suggests that the funding was for technology, but viewers cannot tell from the ad if this is true.</p>
<h4>Page 2 of Newspaper</h4>
  <p><em>Headlines for separate articles : </em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizen Meeting for Concord Field&rdquo; <br>
  &ldquo;New Budget Shows Promise&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Advertisement description: Ad shows a toxic wasteland, factory sludge, and similar. Text of ad says, &ldquo;</em>Is this the future you want for the children of Concord City? Protect our Earth, protect our children. Our kids beg us for no factories. Please don&rsquo;t vote for Rita Republican on Election Day.&rdquo;<br>
  <em>Information for ad: </em>The ad uses a powerfully negative and frightening image of a ruined land. It connects the image to the future of the city, children, Rita&rsquo;s plan to build a factory, and voting for her. The symbolic message is that if you vote for Rita, then Concord City will become a wasteland. It appeals to people&rsquo;s emotions, especially fear. Playing on emotions is a common propaganda technique.</p>
<h4>Page 3 of Newspaper</h4>
  <p><em>Headlines for separate articles: </em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;</em>Laptops Donated to High School&rdquo; <br>
  &ldquo;Experts Say School Test Scores Flawed&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Advertisement description: Shows a farm family in front of run-down home, looking sad. Text of ad is a quote, &ldquo;</em>We tried the new techniques. We trusted Elaine. However, our crops are dying like everyone else&rsquo;s, actually worse. We will be lucky to keep the farm.&rdquo; –Mr. Weltcher, Concord City farmer<br>
  <em>Information for ad: </em>This ad also uses fear. It shows a family in difficult circumstances. Their farm is failing, and they do not have enough income to maintain their property. The ad blames their situation on trying Elaine Environs new farming techniques. It intends to make all farmers in Concord City not vote for Elaine, to make them think her methods fail on real farms like that of the Weltcher&rsquo;s.</p>
<h4>Page 4 of Newspaper</h4>
  <p><em>Headlines for separate articles:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;Factory Talks in Progress&rdquo; <br>
  &ldquo;Annual Grape Festival Cancelled?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Advertisement description: The ad has two side-by-side images, one of broken-down farm equipment and dry orchards and Norman No-Tax in black and white, the other of a lush orchard and a clean tractor driven by a smiling farmer in color. The text of the ad reads &ldquo;</em>Concord City—the local government that has supported its farmers for generations. Support the local government; put someone in office who knows how to protect its people. Norman No-Tax is just a bunch of sour grapes.&rdquo;<br>
  <em>Information for ad: </em>This ad associates Norman No-Tax with sour grapes and failing orchards. The message it sends voters is that Norman has no respect for the city&rsquo;s government. Without mentioning his plan to lower taxes directly, it suggests that doing so will reduce support of city government for the farmers. The ad also plays on fear and uses sour grapes, dry orchards, a broken tractor, and a running tractor as symbols for the choice voters have to make.</p>
<p>Did you notice that each of these ads was an attack against one of the candidates? Attack ads are another common propaganda technique. People try to make a candidate look bad so people will not vote for that person. In candidate advertising, the ads tend to do one of three things. They might acclaim or celebrate a person&rsquo;s successes, like the television ads. Ads can also attack another candidate or defend a candidate from an attack. </p>
