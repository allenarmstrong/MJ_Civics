<h2>Cell Phone Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Teen 1 (holding a cell phone)</strong>—&ldquo;Yea, I&rsquo;m <strong><em>so</em></strong> glad my mom got me a   new cell phone. I swear it jumped out of my pocket right into the toilet! They should make these things waterproof. I cannot go five minutes without texting my friends. It&rsquo;s a good thing I have an unlimited texting and minutes plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Teen 2 (no cell phone)</strong>—&ldquo;Man, my parents won&rsquo;t let me have a cell phone. They say I am too young to need one. They say if I have an emergency, my teacher will let me use the phone. I must be the <strong>only </strong>kid without a cell phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Teen 3 (cell phone)</strong>—&ldquo;I have one, but I can only use it for emergencies. I have few minutes and texts. My dad freaked out when I went over my texting limit last month. Now I have to wait until I get home and   talk to my friends online.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Teen 4 (no cell phone)</strong>—&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m the <strong>only </strong>one around here with no cool stuff—no cell phone, no Internet, no television, no video games. I&rsquo;m really busy anyway with sports and homework, but it would be cool to be a part of what <strong>everyone else </strong>is doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you can see from these teens, parents have different rules about cell phones. This is because opinions about where and when teens should have cell phones are   different.</p>
<p>People also have different ideas about how government should work. The Founding Fathers of the United States studied many of these ideas before creating the federal government.&rdquo;</p>
