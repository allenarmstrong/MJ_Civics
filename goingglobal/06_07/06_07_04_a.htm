<p>[Narrator] The International Court of Justice, or ICJ, has 15 members. It gives advice and makes judgments on situations brought to it. UN members agree to follow its decisions. In the 1990s, the World Health Organization, a part of the UN, and the General Assembly asked the court to make a judgment about using nuclear weapons. The ICJ did not rule the use of nuclear weapons as legal or illegal. However, it noted that international laws that protect health and safety went against their use. It advised that countries should continue to make agreements that prevent the building and use of nuclear weapons.</p>



<h3>Scene #7</h3>
<p>(Image: Picture of President Obama getting a flu shot is on Wikipedia labeled it "U.S. President Barack Obama receives the flu vaccine in 2009.", UN symbol in a corner with caption "World Health Organization, WHO; headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland and all UN members are part of WHO")</p>
<p>[Narrator] The World Health Organization, or WHO, provides leadership and information on health matters for the UN. It studies and provides reports on current health conditions around the world, such as where a disease has spread. The WHO seeks to improve the health of people all over the world. In 2009, it helped speed up response to a worldwide outbreak of influenza, or the flu. It helped different organizations work together to quickly create vaccines that would prevent further spread.</p>




<h3>Scene #8</h3>
<p>(Image: Map image of NATO members, NATO symbol in corner with caption "North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO; 28 members, founded 1949, and headquarters in Brussels, Belgium")</p>
<p>[Narrator] The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, is a military alliance. Like the UN, it began shortly after the end of World War II. Members worried about an attack by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union broke up in 1991, and many of the countries that were part of it have started to build friendly ties with NATO. The main difference from the UN is that NATO is an agreement between countries for mutual defense. That means NATO members agree to help each other if one is attacked. NATO declared the September 11th attacks on the United States as an attack against all members. The NATO countries began working together to stop terrorist activity, including in Afghanistan.</p>



<h3>Scene #9</h3>
<p>(Image: American Red Cross symbol with caption "Red Cross; over 180 member countries, headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, and headquarters for American Red Cross in Washington, D.C.")</p>
<p>[Narrator] The Red Cross is actually a collection of several groups with related names and purposes. It began in 1863 to protect human life and health wherever there is need. The Red Cross assists victims of war and natural disaster. The United States is a member with its national program, the American Red Cross. Clara Barton was an American nurse and teacher who founded the American Red Cross. Millions of Americans learn emergency health skills and donate blood through the Red Cross. Their efforts help those in need within and outside the United States. The American Red Cross worked with other groups to help victims of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.</p>



<h3>Scene #10</h3>
<p>(Image: Map of WTO members, WTO symbol with caption "World Trade Organization, WTO; headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland and 153 members")</p>
<p>[Narrator] The World Trade Organization, or WTO, is a group of countries that work together to make the trade process easier. The WTO makes guidelines to help members work out disputes over trade. It also aims to reduce practices that limit trade, like taxes on imports. The United States was one of the founding members in 1995. They meet every two years and create policies to which the most members will agree. It cooperates with other international organizations.</p>



<h3>Scene #11</h3>
<p>(Image: Peace Corps symbol with caption "Peace Corps Program Areas: health, education, agriculture, environment, business and technology, and youth and community development")</p>
<p>[Narrator] President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961. It is an American organization, but it is international because its volunteers work in many countries. U.S. citizens can be volunteers in the Peace Corps. They receive language and instruction in the culture of the place they will live and work. They stay there for 27 months. Volunteers provide training and work alongside people in one of six main areas. They teach people about U.S. culture as well.</p>
