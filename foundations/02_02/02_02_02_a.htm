<p>Show off how much you learned! Try writing your own rap about the Magna Carta, Mayflower Compact, English Bill of Rights, and <em>Common Sense</em>.</p><br /><br />
<h3>Rap Song</h3>
<p>Chorus:<br />
Let's travel back<br />
To each time<br />
A bunch of words<br />
That got no rhyme<br />
Made an impact<br />
For all to see<br />
Especially colonists<br /> 
And today you and me</p>
<p>First England's King John<br />
In Twelve-fifteen<br />
Signed the Magna Carta<br />
He wasn't too keen<br />
It limited his power<br />
Kings are not divine<br />
People wantin' some rights<br />
Made him sign the line</p>
<p>In Sixteen-twenty<br />
Mayflower riders<br />
Made a compact<br />
To be law-abiders<br />
To laws fair and equal<br />
For the common good<br />
It was a social contract<br />
For the new Plymouth 'hood</p>
<p>(Chorus)<br />
Back in England<br />
Sixteen-eighty-nine<br />
The English Bill of Rights<br />
Protect what's mine<br />
The right to bear arms<br />
And submit petition<br />
Further limits the monarch<br />
Helps my position<br />
<p>Seventeen-seventy-six<br />
American colonists<br />
Had some problems and<br />
Put them in lists<br />
For King George<br />
But they could not agree<br />
On declaring independence<br />
Then along came Tommy</p>
<p>Thomas Paine, that is<br />
Wrote a pamphlet<br />
Called "Common Sense"<br />
They all had to have it<br />
Blaming king and parliament<br />
For their problems<br />
Convinced many colonists<br />
To break off and solve 'em</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
