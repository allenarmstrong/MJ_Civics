<p>Hello there! I'm so glad you are taking this M/J Civics course. By learning how to be an informed citizen, how to find out what's going on in your community, and why civic participation is so important, you can show good citizenship! Our very own Super Citizen will guide you along the way!</p>
<p>It would be easy to be overwhelmed by the course's sheer awesomeness, but if you listen and read carefully, you will be just fine. Here, you see the City of America, the course home page of your course. This course is all about communities. It's about learning what it means to be a good citizen and help make your community better.</p> 
<p>One of the great features in this course is choices. You will make many choices throughout the course. The course has three units in each segment for you to complete. You can choose the order you complete them within each segment! In the first segment, you will focus on citizenship, the foundations of the United States, and the sharing of power in government. In the second segment, you will learn how to be an active citizen, how money affects our civic lives, and how you can be a citizen of the world! You can poke around the units to help you choose which one to complete first! Consider your schedule as well as your interests when making these choices.</p>
<p>The information you learn in this course applies to your everyday life. You will see how citizens make a difference in their society and how you can, too! The Service Learning unit is also very important. You will visit this unit throughout your time in the course, in both segments. It contains the information you need to complete a service-learning project, a requirement of this course. Visit this area early and often and discuss it with your instructor!</p>
<p>In this course, you will complete many types of assessments to show off your developing citizenship skills! Pretests, lesson quizzes, written assessments, Discussion-Based Assessments, unit exams, and segment exams are all ways you will earn your grade. The required Discussion-Based Assessment is a time to talk about your learning with your instructor and clear up any questions you might have. What is super fantastic is that activities in the lessons help you review and practice before you complete each assessment! The practices are fun! You have choices in many lesson assessments as well. To show your learning, you might have the option to create a podcast, a video, a letter, or even a song!</p> 
<p>Good citizens work together, and in this course, you will practice those skills within the collaboration options. You will choose one collaboration option to complete in each segment of the course. When you see this icon in a lesson, you will know it links to instructions for one of the collaboration options. Each segment has five options for you to choose from! Help is available to guide you to success in meeting this requirement. The activities are fun and help you learn more about good citizenship!</p>
<p>You have so many choices in this course, and what you will learn will be important for your whole life! We are so excited to have you here and look forward to watching you grow into a Super Citizen!</p>
