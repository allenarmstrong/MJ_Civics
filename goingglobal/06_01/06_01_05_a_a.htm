<h3>Slide 2</h3>
<p>In the United States, the people elect leaders to represent them at all levels of government. Local, state, and national leaders make decisions on their behalf. The central government shares powers with the 50 states. It makes decisions that affect all the states though the states maintain separate control over their areas.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Choose two of the following terms that best describe the government of the United States.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>democracy</strong>–a form of government run by the people, either directly or indirectly</li>
  <li>autocracy–a government run by one person</li>
  <li>oligarchy–a government run by a few people or a small group of people</li>
  <li>communism–a type of government where the communist party uses its power to implement socialist ideas</li>
  <li>unitary–a government where decisions are made for the whole country</li>
  <li><strong>federation</strong>–a type of government organization where the local and state governments share power with the central government, though the central government has final authority</li>
  <li>confederation–a type of government organization where the local and state governments share power with the central government, though the state governments have final authority</li>
  <li>parliamentary–a country where the legislature has authority over the executive leader or leaders</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Corrrect:</strong> Excellent! You correctly identified the United States as both a federation and a democracy. The United States is a representative democracy, the indirect type, because voters elect leaders to make decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> Oops! One or both of your responses are incorrect. Notice that Americans elect leaders to run the government. In addition, note that while the U.S. states share power with the central government, the central government has the final authority.</p>
<h3>Slide 3</h3>
<p>Neighboring nations Mexico and Canada have similar systems to the United States. Both are federations and elect leaders. As a former part of the United Kingdom, Canada still recognizes the monarch. The British monarch chooses a governor–general for Canada who approves laws and people to fill many positions. Mexico has a president that may only serve one six-year term, while the U.S. president may serve two four-year terms.</p>
