<h2>Option D: Speak to a Leader</h2>
<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Talk to a community leader about an ecological issue in your area. The person could be a city official or the leader of a volunteer group. Ask a trusted adult to help you arrange the interview. Ask what he or she thinks about the issue and how citizens can help. Find out what he or she is doing about the issue. For help with your interview, view the <a class="pop" href="http://library.flvs.net/learning_objects/Research_Asset_Gold_v1.5/index.html" title="Library.flvs.net" target="_new">Research Asset Guide</a> at library.flvs.net.</li>
      <li>Summarize your interview in at least two well-written paragraphs. Include the full name of the person you interviewed. In your summary, describe what you learned from the interview and be sure to answer the following questions:<br /><br />
        What is the issue?<br />
        How is it an ecological issue?<br />
        How does it relate to conservation?<br />
        Why is it a problem in your area?<br />
        How is the government involved in this issue?<br />
        What can citizens do to help?</li>
      <li>Use a map to identify the area(s) in your local community affected by your chosen issue. You may use the map you created for your CAP file. Save your image to your computer.</li>
      <li>Make sure to save your interview information, summary, and map to one file to turn in.</li>
    </ol>
