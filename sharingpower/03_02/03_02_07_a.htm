<h2>Legislative Branch Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Examine the words of the Florida Constitution and the U.S. Constitution related to the legislative branch to see how they compare.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives and Sentate are on the top tier. Auditor General and Commission of Ethics are on the second tier below the first.</p>
<h3>Florida</h3>
<h4>Article III</h4>
<p><strong>Section 1. Composition</strong>—The legislative power of the state shall be vested in a legislature of the State of Florida, consisting of a senate composed of one senator elected from each senatorial district and a house of representatives composed of one member elected from each representative district.</p>
<h3>United States</h3>
<h4>Article. I.</h4>
<p><strong>Section 1</strong>—All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>The organization and titles of the Florida constitution differ from the U.S. Constitution. However, both create three branches of government. Here we see how each introduces the legislative branch. The U.S. legislative branch is called Congress, while in Florida it is the Florida Legislature. We use the term state legislature to describe this branch in general for any state.</p>
