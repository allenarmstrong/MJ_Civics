<h2>The U.S. Court System Text Version</h2>
<p>This image shows both the state-level and federal-level court systems in the United States.</p> 
<p>Federal cases begin in an U.S. District Court. Cases appealed from a U.S. District Court could go to a U.S. Court of Appeals. If a case decision is appealed again, it could go to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court and the court of last resort in the United States.</p>
 <p>The lowest state-level court is the court of original jurisdiction. Cases appealed from that court would go to a state-level court of appeals. A case decision from the state-level court of appeals might be appealed to the state-level court of last resort, often named the state's supreme court. Cases appealed from the state-level court of last resort could go to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
