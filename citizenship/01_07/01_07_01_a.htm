<h2>Citizen Skills Text Version</h2>

  &ldquo;I come here each Saturday to help and listen. I am not paid or anything. I do it because it helps people. We talk, and I learn about their lives. Many people have such fascinating stories. Some people have no family members to visit them here. I try to make people laugh or have some fun playing a game. It feels good to help make another person&rsquo;s day a little bit better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image of teen collecting donations of toys)<br />
  &ldquo;In one of my classes I read a story about a kid who never had any toysâ€”or much of anything at all. I learned that many families in my community are too poor to provide their children more than just basic needs. I convinced my classmates to help me collect new toys to donate to a local charity. The charity will deliver them to needy children. I hope that our efforts will be result in a happy surprise for many children.</p>

  &ldquo;My city is planning to shut down our youth center to save money. Many students went there every day because it was a safe place to hang out and study. I worry that without the center more kids will get in trouble or hurt. They may not do as well in school. I am writing a letter to my city council to suggest ways we can keep the center open and still save money.&rdquo;</p>
