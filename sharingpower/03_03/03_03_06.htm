<h1>What About the U.S. Constitution?</h1>
<p>The <span class="tooltip">U.S. Constitution<span><strong>U.S. Constitution:</strong> plan detailing the structure, functions, and powers of the government of the United States, also known as the Constitution</span></span> does not make law, but it is the foundation for laws and lawmaking in the United States. It is a guide for how the federal government should function. Courts use the document as a guide when a law is challenged. The states and people have rights that the Constitution protects and does not take away. The <span class="tooltip">U.S. Congress<span><strong>U.S. Congress:</strong> official name for the legislative branch of the U.S. government</span></span>, state governments, and local governments are sources of laws because they create them.</p> 
<p>The government, including individual officials, must obey laws and the Constitution. Note that even the president is not above the law. The president may not use powers not given to the president by the Constitution or through laws passed by Congress. The president must pay taxes and have a license to drive a car just like other Americans under laws passed by Congress and state governments. No one is below the law, either, meaning that every American has the same rights under law. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution protects the rights of citizens to be treated the same way under the laws. For example, people could not have their driver's license taken away because a judge did not like the clothes they wore or did not like the area where they lived. However, they could lose their license for breaking a law.</p>
