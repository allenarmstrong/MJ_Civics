<h1>What Is A Jury Trial?</h1>
<p>A <span class="tooltip">jury<span><strong>Jury:</strong> a group of ordinary citizens who decide together whether a person accused of a crime is guilty or not guilty</span></span> is a group of ordinary citizens who decide together whether a person accused of a crime is guilty or not guilty. A <span class="tooltip">trial<span><strong>Trial:</strong> a formal legal process in court to settle disputes or determine the guilt or innocence of those accused of crimes</span></span> is a formal legal process in court to settle disputes or determine if a person accused of a crime is guilty or not guilty. Sometimes only a <span class="tooltip">judge<span><strong>Judge:</strong> high-ranking court officer who supervises trials, instructs juries, and delivers trial outcomes</span></span> will hear and decide cases. We call this a <span class="tooltip">bench trial<span><strong>Bench Trial:</strong> trial held without a jury, where the judge solely reviews the evidence and makes a decision about the case</span></span>. However, a jury can decide whether a person is guilty or not in a <span class="tooltip">criminal case<span><strong>Criminal Case:</strong> a lawsuit brought before a court involving someone who is accused of committing a crime</span></span>. A jury may also decide whether a person owes <span class="tooltip">compensation<span><strong>Compensation:</strong> money to pay for or make up for a loss</span></span> to another person in a <span class="tooltip">civil case<span><strong>Civil Case:</strong> a lawsuit brought before a court relating to the rights of citizens, usually a dispute between citizens</span></span>.</p>
<p>A criminal case would center on a person who is accused of breaking a law. The person is a suspect in a crime against society, so the government pursues the case. A civil case is a dispute between two people or groups of people. An example of a civil case is when one person sues another. People who have disagreements over property and other issues may choose to have a court of law settle their problem.</p>
