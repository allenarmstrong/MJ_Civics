<h1>What Does It Mean to Influence Government?</h1>
<p>In the United States, voters elect <span class="tooltip">representatives<span><strong>Representative:</strong> a person chosen to speak and act for their fellow citizens in government</span></span> to make decisions for them. They expect the people they choose to be model citizens. Voters expect them to work hard and use their best judgment. To represent people well, elected leaders should know about the peoples' concerns. Therefore, citizens must take an active role in influencing government, to make sure elected leaders are meeting expectations.</p>

<p>Active citizens influence government in many ways. Sometimes they act alone. Often they are more powerful acting as part of a group. For example, when city council members hear about a problem from one resident, they may not feel pressure to act right away. Officials must consider information from many sources before deciding the best course of action. When tens of thousands send emails and make calls on the same problem, though, the city council members simply cannot wait! They still will research the problem, but may move it ahead of other tasks knowing how many people are concerned.</p>
<p>The people depend on elected leaders to represent them well. In turn, the leaders depend on the participation of citizens to be good representatives. If people do not contact officials to express their opinions, the officials may not have the information they need to make the best decisions for the people they represent. It is also important for active citizens to monitor the actions of elected officials to ensure their choices accurately reflect the needs of the community.</p>
