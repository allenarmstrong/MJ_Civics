                <p>The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects people from searches without a strong reason to suspect wrongdoing.<br/><br/>Amy is the wife of a soldier but not in the military herself. She was stopped by police while shopping at the mall and all her belongings searched. They let her go, finding no stolen goods. Amy was embarrassed and believes her rights were violated by the search. The officer says the law allows him to search anyone who looks suspicious.

                Yes! Though Amy is a soldier's wife, she is not in the military herself, so military law does not apply in this situation. Since she believes her rights under the Constitution were wrongly taken away, it is a question of constitutional law.
