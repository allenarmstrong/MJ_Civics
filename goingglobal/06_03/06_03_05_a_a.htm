<h2>Resources: Answers Text Version</h2>
<p>Chocolate Land and Lollipop Land are two island countries in a warm climate. Both grow large amounts of sugarcane.</p>
<p>Lollipop Land's main crop is sugar. The people there focus on making lollipops from it. The country is famous around the world for its lollipops. Most people work in the sugar cane fields or in the factories that make the lollipops. The people have been using the same recipes for over 100 years. They are very proud of their traditions and resist new ideas that would change their ways.</p> 
<p>Chocolate Land grows cocoa beans and many crops in addition to sugar. It also has dairy farms. Its major products are cocoa powder, chocolate candies and desserts, milk, butter, cheese, and beef. The people grow some fruits and grains, mostly used to make interesting chocolate flavors. They also make lollipops, including chocolate ones, but not as many. Chocolate Land also has a theme park that attracts tourists. There you can ride chocolate-themed rides and learn the history of making chocolate on the island. Hotels are near the park as well as shops selling shirts and postcards.</p>
<h3>Scenario 1</h3>
<p>Tropical storms hit both islands. The storms destroy the sugar cane fields of both countries.</p>
<p>Which country do you think will have a more difficult recovery?</p>
<ol>
<li>Chocolate Land</li>
<li><strong>Lollipop Land</strong></li>
<li>Neither, they will have an equally difficult recovery.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback for A "Chocolate Land"</strong><br>
Oops, think again! Chocolate Land has other goods and services it can sell while the sugar crops recover. It can continue to export beef, milk, and cocoa powder. It can clean up the resort and park areas to encourage tourists to come back. Lollipop Land, however, depends on its lollipops only. Without sugar, it cannot make them. Without money from exporting lollipops, it cannot even buy sugar from another country until its own crops recover.</p>

<h3>Scenario 2</h3>
<p>Technology Land, a place with little farming but plenty of Internet companies, is studying both Lollipop Land and Chocolate Land. The leaders of Technology Land are interested in trading with a country that can supply a few of their food needs. They hope that, in return, they could export some of their technology products to the new trade partner.</p>
<p>Which country do you think will be more interesting to the leaders of Technology Land?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chocolate Land</strong></li>
<li>Lollipop Land</li>
<li>They are equally interesting.</li>
</ol>

You are right! Chocolate Land has a wider variety of food products it can export than Lollipop Land. Some of them are actually nutritious! With Chocolate Land's theme park, shops, and hotels, Technology Land could sell products that provide new rides or experiences for visitors to Chocolate Land. Technology Land will not see as much opportunity to export its products to Lollipop Land.</p>

<h3>Scenario 3</h3>
<p>An inventor discovers how to convert sugar into energy to fuel machines. It can replace oil and gasoline. Both Chocolate Land and Lollipop Land import oil and gasoline from other countries.</p>
<p>Which country is more likely to use this discovery for its own benefit?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chocolate Land</strong></li>
<li>Lollipop Land</li>
<li>Neither is likely to use the discovery.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback for A "Chocolate Land"</strong><br>
You are right! Chocolate Land has a greater need for fuel than Lollipop Land. Not only does it have factories for a variety of products, but also those rides at the theme park need a lot of energy! Chocolate Land could save money by using some of its own sugar for fuel. Lollipop Land, however, does not use as much fuel. In addition, it needs all of the sugar it grows to make the lollipops it exports. It does not have the land, equipment, or people available to explore growing sugar to meet fuel needs.</p>

<h3>Scenario 4</h3>
<p>A worldwide news site reports that sugar is the number one cause of disease in humans. Doctors around the globe are urging patients to stop eating sugar and foods that contain it.</p>
<p>Which country will suffer more because of this news?</p>
<ol>
<li>Chocolate Land</li>
<li><strong>Lollipop Land</strong></li>
<li>They will suffer equally.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback for A "Chocolate Land"</strong><br>
Oops, think again! Chocolate Land does not depend only on sugar, though it does use a lot of sugar in the products it sells. However, it could direct more focus on its dairy and beef industries. It could develop chocolate products that use less sugar. It would still have products to export to other countries. It could still attract tourism by focusing on its attractions more than the chocolate by itself. Lollipop Land does not have other products it can sell and would suffer a great loss of business in trade. Lollipops are mostly sugar. Trying to reduce the sugar used would mean changing their recipes. The old recipes are important to their tradition and the fame of their lollipops.</p>

<h3>Scenario 5</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, Technology Land finds itself at war. Several countries are in conflict over control of land. They are focusing on their war and all trade has stopped. The countries at war were big trading partners for Chocolate Land and Lollipop Land.</p>
<p>Which country will have a more difficult time providing for its people as long as the war continues?</p>
<ol>
<li>Chocolate Land</li>
<li><strong>Lollipop Land</strong></li>
<li>Neither will have a more difficult time than the other.</li>

Oops, think again! Remember, Chocolate Land has a greater variety of industries. It can provide many of its people's food needs by selling crops at home instead of exporting them or using them in chocolate. In addition, it could attract other new countries to trade with and perhaps meet its needs. Lollipop Land is not so lucky. It mostly grows sugar. The people there have little experience growing anything else. Food will be a great challenge for Lollipop Land. It will have a difficult time attracting new trade partners with only lollipops to offer.</p>
