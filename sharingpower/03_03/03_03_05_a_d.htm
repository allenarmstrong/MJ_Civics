<h2>What is rule of law?  Text Version</h2>

<p><strong>Mr. Tim Warner:</strong> What is rule of law? You might have heard that term before, "rule of law," well basically it means that no one is above the law. That the law of a land should be applied to everyone, that we all have to abide by the law, and that no one can be above the law not even, let's say, the President of the United States.</p>
