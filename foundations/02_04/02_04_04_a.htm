    <th valign="top">Why It Caused a Problem</th>
  </thead>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Each state had one vote in the legislative branch.</td>
    <td valign="top">States with larger populations, like Virginia, did not think   it was fair to have the same amount of power as a state with fewer people. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td valign="top">The government did not have an executive branch.</td>
    <td valign="top">When Congress passed a law, the state governments were   supposed to enforce it. Congress had no power to make sure each state   enforced the law. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">The government did not have a separate judicial branch.</td>
    <td valign="top">If a law’s meaning was in question, there was no one who   could fairly settle the issue and make sure all states followed the ruling. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td valign="top">Congress could not create taxes.</td>
    <td valign="top">Taxes pay for a government’s functions. Congress could only   request money from the state legislatures. If the states did not send any, Congress   was powerless. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Congress could not raise a national military separate from   the states.</td>
    <td valign="top">During the Revolutionary War, General George Washington requested money for supplies. Congress could not force the states to pay. The troops often went without, starving at times.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td valign="top">Each state printed its own currency.</td>
    <td valign="top">A person might need paper money from several different   states to do business. Currencies from different states did not have the same   value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">Congress could not control trade between states and with   other nations.</td>
    <td valign="top">Each state acted for its own benefit and did not consider   the good of the whole nation. Other nations could take advantage of   differences in the states’ trade agreements.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
    <td valign="top">New laws would require the support of nine of the 13 states,   more than a majority.</td>
    <td valign="top">Congress had a difficult time passing laws because nearly all   of the states would have to agree. Its work was limited as a result.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">The Articles of Confederation required unanimous agreement of the   states to amend the   document.</td>
    <td valign="top">Congress realized that the Articles of Confederation needed   changes. Yet it could do nothing without all the states’ support. Unanimous   agreement is rare, even in everyday situations.</td>
