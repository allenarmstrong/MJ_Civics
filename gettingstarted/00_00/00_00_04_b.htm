<h2>Course Walkthrough Text Version</h2>
<p>[Super Citizen] Hello there! This course is easy to navigate. Let's see what's in here!</p>
<p>The course home page  shows the units you can choose. Each building is a unit. Segment One units appear on the left, while Segment Two units and the Service Learning unit appear on the right. Select a unit to access the lessons and content within it. Once you begin working in one unit, remain in it until you have completed the entire unit.</p>
<p>When you enter each unit, you will enter the introduction lesson for the unit. Each unit is organized by lessons. Once you are in a lesson, you will notice that there are several pages within each lesson. Move from one page to the next using the forward and back arrows.</p>
<p>You can return to the course home page at any time using the Back to Home and Course Home buttons.</p>
<p>The introduction tells you about the unit and includes a checklist. The checklist lists the unit's lessons, the time it should take you to complete the lessons, and the points each assessment is worth. Printing or saving the checklist will help you track your progress through the course.</p>
<p>You can also access other lessons and units while inside a lesson. Find the Unit menu along the top of your screen. It will allow you to move between units. The Lessons menu will allow you to move between lessons in a unit.</p>
<p>Each lesson has an introduction. Lessons have objectives that tell you what you will be able to do once you complete the lesson. This page also contains your CAP file for the lesson. (CAP iconâ€”looks like a sketched patriotic baseball cap with C.A.P. on it.) You will see this icon in every lesson. CAP files are a tool for you to use to take and make notes during your lessons. Print them out and save them in a folder or binder. You may instead copy and paste them into a document that you can save in a folder on your computer. Fill in your CAP file as you complete each lesson. Completing and studying your CAP files will help you successfully complete your assessments, exams, and Discussion-Based Assessments! Each lesson also has a ReCAP page to help you review the lesson content. The last page in a lesson explains how to complete your lesson assessment. Some lessons have a link to a rubric. Rubrics explain how the work you complete will be graded.</p>
<p>Within the lessons, you will also notice there are times when you need to select the Continue or OK button to begin an activity. Be sure to complete all the activities in the course so you will be prepared for assessments!</p>
<p>You will also notice that certain words or phrases in the lessons appear in blue. These are glossary terms. When you roll over a glossary term, you will see you can select the term to read its definition. You can then select the &ldquo;x&rdquo; to close the definition. Glossary terms are also located in the course glossary. The glossary is a great resource to copy into a document and save to your desktop or print and have available.</p>
<p>You might see a lesson page with a tabbed panel. Be sure to select each tab so you don't miss anything important!</p>
<p>Some lessons contain helpful instructions for you to complete an activity or for additional information on a topic. You can access these instructions by selecting the text link.</p>
<p>The Course Resources button contains activities and notes from your lessons that will help you review your assessments.</p>
<p>Because you will likely be storing work on your computer, it is a good idea to set up a desktop folder for this course on your computer. To do this, right-click on your desktop and choose New, and then choose Folder. Name the folder &ldquo;Civics Course.&rdquo; Alternatively, you could have a folder to store printed documents from this course.</p>
<p>Finally, enjoy this course and become a Super Citizen, just like me!</p>
