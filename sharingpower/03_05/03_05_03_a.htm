<h2>Levels of Government Text Version</h2>
<p>Image showing how the levels of government affect lawmaking processes.</p>
<p>Federal Government is at the top of the diagram, signifying its supremacy under the Constitution. State Governments reside below the federal level, and Local Governments take the bottom position. If a law from the state or local government conflicts with a federal law, it is the federal law that will be used as a standard in the courts. Due to the impact that federal laws often have on the laws passed by state and local governments, these state and local governments must follow the federal laws just like individual citizens.</p>
