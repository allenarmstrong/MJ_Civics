<p>North America has a variety of natural resources. Countries import and export goods and services to other countries to get what they need and want. Trade is the word we use to describe this buying and selling between countries. A country's available resources help determine the goods and services it will produce. They produce the products that are most efficient for them to make at home. Diversification is important to minimize risk of failure and loss of trade in an economy.</p>
