<h2>Audio Text Version</h2>
<p>[Officer] What is your name and what are you doing out so late, young man?</p>
<p>[Teen] My name is Brian Fromage. I was just heading to the convenience store. I wanted some cheese puffs because my dog got into the bag I had and, well … the dog likes cheese puffs a lot.</p>
<p>[Officer] Hmm. Don't you realize it's 10:13 p.m. and past curfew? </p>
<p>[Teen] Uh, curfew? I didn't know about a curfew.</p>
<p>[Officer] Yes, the city council passed it two weeks ago. It's for your own safety. I will let you go with a warning this time. Next time, I will not. I suggest that you keep your cheese puffs out of the dog's reach.</p>
<p>[Teen] Oh … okay … so can I go get the cheese puffs first?</p>
<p>[Officer] No, you need to head straight home. I will be watching.</p>
