<h1>Where Do Laws Come From?</h1>
<p>Many laws are created because of a need to protect people's rights. American leaders agree that laws must apply equally to everyone. An exception is those convicted of serious crimes who may have lost certain rights. For example, a person convicted of murder may no longer vote in the United States by federal law. Governments make laws to protect the safety and rights of Americans as a group, not only for individuals. The laws and the process for making them should be freely available, so everyone is aware and can have a voice in making the laws.</p>
<p>Lawmakers at the local, state, and federal levels are the main source of law. The courts can also be a source of law, called common law or case law. Examine this slideshow to learn more about the specific sources of law that lawmakers and courts create.</p>

    			<h2>Statutes</h2> 
                <h3>What It Is</h3>
                <p>A law established by a lawmaking group of people</p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
        		<p>Imagine your city council passes a statute, or law, that says all parade organizers must give the city at least 60 days' notice before the planned event to obtain approval.</p>

                <h3>What It Is</h3>
                <p>An official rule or order that guides behavior related to statutes</p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
        		<p>Imagine the city's mayor then issues an order saying that parade approval will depend on whether enough officers are available on the planned day to help direct traffic and protect safety.</p>

    			<h2>Case Law</h2> 
                <h3>What It Is</h3>
                <p>Decisions or interpretations of law made by judges and applied to new cases</p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
        		<p>Imagine then that an organization in the city sues the city for refusing their parade request. They sent in their request 30 days before the event, but that was before the statute passed. The judge decided that the city should still consider their application. If any other groups had a parade application denied for the same reason, the city will also have to reconsider those applications because of the judge's decision.</p>
