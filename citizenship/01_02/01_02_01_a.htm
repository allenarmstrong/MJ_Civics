<h2>On the street: What is your favorite U.S. landmark?</h2>


<p>[Female Interviewee #1] The most famous U.S. landmark to me would be the Golden Gate Bridge. It's man-made, it's nice, it's beautiful, and it's in the beautiful city of San Francisco – my home city.</p>

<p>[Male Interviewee #1] It would be the Statue of Liberty just because I've never seen it before and I've just seen it on TV a lot.</p>

<p>[Female Interviewee #2] I would like to see Mt. Rushmore, personally, but that's just because it seems cool.</p>

<p>[Female Interviewee #3] …Especially when you learn about how they used dynamite to actually shape it.</p>

<p>[Male Interviewee #2] …It's actually a mountain.</p>

<p>[Male Interviewee #3] I do have one that's not man-made; it's naturally made – Yellowstone.</p>

<p>[Female Interviewee #4] Well, the Statue of Liberty wasn't made in America, but I would've said that.</p>

<p>[Female Interviewee #5] A couple of years ago we went to the Grand Canyon and it was amazing.</p>

<p>[Female Interviewee #1] It's a really good feeling to be on that bridge to feel the wind blowing and just to see all the marine life there.</p>

<p>[Female Interviewee #5] I was so awe-struck by it. I heard a lot of people say, "Oh, it's just a big hole in the ground and it's over-hyped and over-talked about," but I definitely didn't feel that way; I could have spent days looking at it.</p>

<p>[Female Interviewee #6] The Lincoln Memorial.  I've been there in Washington, D.C., and it was just the most beautiful, spectacular place. The statue was really awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>[Female Interviewee #7] Alright, I can't choose a favorite; they're all so fantastic!</p>
