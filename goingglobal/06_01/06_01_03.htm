  <h1>Who Has the Power?</h1>
<p>Many different types of governments exist around the world. Each nation's government establishes control over its territory and people through law. Nations that have the same basic type of government can appear very different. No two nations' governments and laws are the same.</p>
<p>Government structures differ in two main ways. One way is the role the general population plays in making decisions. The other is how the nation manages its political divisions, such as states or counties.</p>
<p>Let's look at some basic types of government and how much power each gives to citizens.</p>

              <h2>Types of Government</h2>
              <p>Three main types of government differ in how much power the people have in making decisions. They are: </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>democracy</li>
                  <li>oligarchy</li>
                  <li>autocracy</li>

              <p>A <strong>democracy</strong> is a government run by the people, either directly or indirectly.</p>
              <p>There are two types of democracies:</p>
              <p>A <strong>direct democracy</strong> is a form of government where the laws are made directly by the citizens. A true direct democracy would be very difficult to achieve. It would require all citizens to 
              take part in making decisions.</p>
              <p>A <strong>representative democracy</strong> or republic is a government that is run indirectly by the people. This means that the people elect representatives to make decisions for them. We can call the 
              United States a representative democracy or <strong>republic</strong>. </p>

              <p>An <strong>oligarchy</strong> is a government run by a few people or a small group of people.</p>
              <p>A single political party often runs an oligarchy. Leaders of the party have the highest positions in government. Decisions for the nation all are in line with the party's ideas.</p>

              <p>An autocracy is a government run by one person.</p> 
              <p>There are several types of autocracies. One type is a <strong>monarchy</strong>. A monarchy is a government run by a king or queen. Usually a monarchy is hereditary. This means that each new king or 
              queen is a family member of the previous one, usually a son or daughter. In general, the monarch rules for life.</p>
              <p>Another type of autocracy is a <strong>dictatorship</strong>. A dictator is one person who rules a nation by force. The dictator makes all government decisions sometimes with advice from advisors with 
              similar views. Dictators intend to rule for life.</p>

              <h2>Socialism and Communism</h2>
              <div class="right img"> 
              <img src="images/karl_marx.jpg"  width="250" />

              </div>
              <p>People usually discuss socialism and communism together. They are two separate ideas, however. Socialism is actually an economic system. It limits individual choice and ownership. Socialists 
              believe all resources should be shared and used to benefit everyone.</p>
              
              <p>Communism is a type of government where the communist party is the most powerful. The goal of a communist party is to put socialist 
              ideas into practice. Its leaders make the important economic decisions. Examples include where to build stores, who will manage them, and what crops to grow. </p>
              
              <p>Communist governments are usually run by one, a few, or a small group of people that believes in socialism. Therefore, we can describe them as an autocracy or oligarchy. It depends on the specific 
              nation. They often have to keep power by force and limit trade with other nations. They try to meet their needs mostly with the resources available in the nation.</p>
             <!-- <p>(Image – Karl Marx, with caption: Karl Marx was a philosopher. Many communist nations base their governments in part on his ideas.)</p>-->
