      CEE.8.1.A: Scarcity is the condition of not being able to have all of the goods and services that one wants. It exists because human wants for goods and services exceed the quantity of goods and services that can be produced using all available resources.<br>
      CEE.8.1.C: Choices involve trading off the expected value of one opportunity against the expected value of its best alternative.<br>
      CEE.8.2.A: To determine the best level of consumption of a product, people must compare the additional benefits with the additional costs of consuming a little more or a little less.<br>
      CEE.8.4.A: Responses to incentives are predictable because people usually pursue their self-interest.<br>
      CEE.8.8.A: An increase in the price of a good or service encourages people to look for substitutes, causing the quantity demanded to decrease, and vice versa. This relationship between price and quantity demanded, known as the law of demand, exists as long as other factors influencing demand do not change.<br>
      CEE.8.9.A: Sellers compete on the basis of price, product quality, customer service, product design and variety, and advertising.<br>
      CEE.8.9.B: Competition among buyers of a product results in higher product prices.<br>
      CEE.8.9.C: The level of competition in a market is influenced by the number of buyers and sellers.<br>
      CEE.8.10: Institutions evolve and are created to help individuals and groups accomplish their goals. Banks, labor unions, markets, corporations, legal systems, and not-for-profit organizations are examples of important institutions. A different kind of institution, clearly defined and enforced property rights, is essential to a market economy.<br>
      CEE.8.10.A: Banks and other financial institutions channel funds from savers to borrowers and investors.<u> <br>
      </u>CEE.8.14.A: Entrepreneurs compare the expected benefits of entering a new enterprise with the expected costs.<br>
      CEE.8.14.B: Entrepreneurs accept the risks in organizing resources to produce goods and services because they hope to earn profits.<br>
      CEE.8.3.D: National economies vary in the extent to which they rely on government directives (central planning) and signals from private markets (prices) to allocate scarce goods, services, and productive resources.<br>
      CEE.8.16.C: In the United States, the federal government enforces antitrust laws and regulations to try to maintain effective levels of competition in as many markets as possible; frequently, however, laws and regulations also have unintended effects for example reducing competition.<br>
      CEE.8.16.D: Most federal government tax revenue comes from personal income and payroll taxes. Payments to social security recipients, the costs of national defense, medical expenditures, and interest payments on the national debt constitute the bulk of federal government spending.<br>
      CEE.8.16.E: Most state and local government revenues come from sales taxes, grants from the federal government, personal income taxes, and property taxes. The bulk of state and local government revenue is spent is for education, public welfare, road construction and repair, and public safety.<br>
      CEE.8.20: Federal government budgetary policy and the Federal Reserve System’s monetary policy influence the overall levels of employment, output, and prices.</td>

      CEE.8.7.E: An exchange rate is the price of one nation's currency in terms of another nations currency. Like other prices, exchange rates are determined by the forces of supply and demand. Foreign exchange markets allocate international currencies.<br>
      CEE.8.18.A: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a basic measure of a nation's economic output and income. It is the total market value, measured in dollars, of all final goods and services produced in the economy in one year.<br>
