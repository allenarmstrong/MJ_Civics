            <p>The people of a colony near the United States are under the rule of a faraway country. You hear reports that the ruling country treats its people badly and 
            they want independence. The people have revolted and set up their own government. Violence erupted between those loyal to the ruling country and the rebels. You 
            sent a battleship to stay nearby to protect Americans staying there. The ruling country is angry that the United States seems to support the revolt. Then you receive 
            news that the U.S. battleship suffered an explosion and sunk.</p>

              <p>President McKinley made the same choice. In 1898, Cuba was owned by and in revolt against Spain. Americans thought Spain's continued efforts to control 
              other lands was harmful to U.S. interests. Congress gave President McKinley permission to intervene by sending troops to help the Cubans. As a result, Spain declared war on the United States. </p>

              <p>Fighting between the two countries happened in two areas—the Caribbean and the Pacific. After nearly four months, the war was over. Spain suffered major defeats. In the

              <p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt would have agreed with all of these actions, just at different times. World War II broke out in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France 
              declared war on Germany. They were frustrated with Adolf Hitler's imperialism against other countries in Europe. Japan had been in conflict with the Soviet Union and China. Soon Japan 
              allied with Germany, and the war grew to involve Europe and Asia. At first, the United States' response was isolationism. It did not want to get involved in another world war so far 
              away. However, the war soon disrupted trade and began to hurt the United States. </p>

              <p>The United States began sending supplies to its allies, especially Britain. The president met with the British prime minister to establish goals for what should happen after the war, 
              trying diplomacy. However, it was not until December 1941 that the United States officially entered the war. The Japanese attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Soon after, 
              President Roosevelt declared war on Japan and then Germany.</p>

              <p>President Bill Clinton did not act, and he regrets the decision. The real-life events mark a failure of international leadership. The country of Rwanda gained independence from Belgium 
              in 1962. Two main groups of people in Rwanda competed for years for power. The Hutu and Tutsi peoples distrusted and feared each other. The Hutus took control of the new government. They 
              fought a bloody civil war with the Tutsis from 1990&#8211;1993.  When a peace agreement was signed, people from other countries, including UN workers, were leaving Rwanda.</p>

              <p>Many in Rwanda did not support the peace treaty. In April 1994, the Hutu president died when his plane was shot down. The Hutus planned genocide against the Tutsis. Genocide means the 
              intentional killing or attempt to kill an entire group of people. Between 500,000 and one million Tutsis died in violent attacks that year. Some UN peacekeepers were in Rwanda, but they were 
              powerless to stop the violence. Information about the bloodshed was slow to reach world leaders. Even then, many were reluctant to act. What happened in Rwanda is a lesson that international 
              cooperation can fail. Today, the UN assists the survivors and teaches people about Rwanda to prevent such horror in the future.</p>

            <p>You receive word that your country has been attacked. As you learn more information, you find out that those responsible belong to a group that controls another country by force. The particular 
            group has attacked before on U.S. territory and the territory of countries that are allies. Americans want justice, but finding the specific leaders will be difficult. Not all of your allies support 
            invading the country.</p>

            <div class="ui_dialog incorrect correct" title="Answer">
              <p>President George W. Bush would have agreed with all of these actions, and did indeed take all of them. On September 11, 2001, members of a terrorist organization attacked the United 
              States. Nearly 3,000 people died, including hundreds of rescue workers. The members of NATO declared the attack as an offense against all members, and most pledged support to the United 
              States. Many of the people responsible for the attack and their supporters were hiding in and in control of Afghanistan. </p>

              <p>The United States, with the help of many of its allies, invaded the country and removed the terrorists from power. The United Nations later sent peacekeepers to help secure the capital 
              city. However, work in Afghanistan continues over 10 years later. The country's geography and people upset with the U.S. invasion are difficult challenges. U.S. forces finally found Osama 
              bin Laden in 2011. He was the main person who led the September 11, 2001 attacks. </p>
