<h2>Naturalization Text Version</h2>
<p>Maria explaining what happened during several steps of the naturalization process:</p>
<p>"First, you must be at least 18 to apply for U.S. citizenship. Parents who are working to become naturalized citizens can also apply for their children under 18. My parents speak little English, so I waited until I turned 18 to apply for myself. I hope I complete the process in time so I can vote for the next president!</p>
<p>Along with the age requirement, I had to be a legal, permanent resident of the United States for at least five years to apply. This means I had permission to live in the country by law. It also means I was physically present here for five years or more. My parents obtained green cards 10 years ago and brought me to this country. If I were married to a U.S. citizen, I would only have to have lived here for three years first. I have no plans to be married, though, so it was five years for me!</p>
<p>The application is really long. I have to turn it in with photographs of myself and other documents to prove my age and residency. I also must send money with it to pay for someone&rsquo;s time examining and filing my documents. Oh, and I have to pay to be fingerprinted. The cool thing is that they use scanners for this nowâ€”no yucky ink on my fingers!</p>
<p>I live in an area with high immigration. Many people apply for citizenship around here. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, or INS office is very busy. I had to wait many months before I heard anything about my application. It was so hard to wait, but I finally received an envelope from the INS office! The letter tells me to come to the office on a certain day and time for my interview.</p>
<p>During my interview, the agent asked me questions about my application and background. I answered questions about my plans and desire to be a U.S. citizen. After the interview, I took the English and civics tests. When I first moved here, I made it my goal to learn English as quickly as possible. I wanted to have an easier time making friends. Now I am very good with the language, so I am sure I aced that test!</p>
<p>After the interview and tests, I heard the most wonderful news. The INS office decided that I should become a U.S. citizen! The last thing I have to do is take the Oath of Allegiance. I received a letter with a new date and time for this ceremony.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been almost two years since my 18th birthday, when I downloaded the application. Today I am dressed up for my ceremony. My family is here, too. The INS agent asked me some questions about life since my interview. I returned my permanent resident card. I have a U.S. flag and I am ready to take my oath and become a legal U.S. citizen. Whenever I sing &lsquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rsquo; I will think of this day and how happy I am to be here!"</p>
