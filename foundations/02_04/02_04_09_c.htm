<p>Urgent Message from the Constitutional Convention!</p>
<p>Help Us! State leaders are demanding to know why we are starting over instead of fixing the Articles of Confederation. They say we must have a good reason or we will be replaced!</p>
<p>Your input will help us explain to them why this is important. In your opinion, what are the three greatest weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation? Explain how each of the weaknesses you chose requires us to write a new Constitution.</p>
<p>In addition, we have the Preamble to our new Constitution ready. Please rewrite it in your own words to help others understand its meaning. You may be creative with your interpretation.</p>
