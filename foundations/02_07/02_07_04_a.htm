<h2>School Text Version</h2>
<p>A school is an example of a place where laws may restrict individual rights to protect the common good. For example, students have the right to assemble under the First Amendment. However, school officials may set rules around when, why, and how assemblies may occur. Restrictions help protect safety for everyone at the school.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has ruled on various laws affecting rights not only in schools but in other public areas as well.</p>
