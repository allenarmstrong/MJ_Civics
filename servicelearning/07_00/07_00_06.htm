<h1>What Is Service?</h1>
<p><span class="tooltip">Service<span><strong>Service:</strong> helping other people in the community</span></span> is helping other people. It is about being active in your community. For example, one group of teens planted a community garden where they grow a variety of vegetables. The garden requires regular care. The teens donate the produce to a local soup kitchen. Workers there use the produce to help feed people in the community. By tending the garden and donating their produce, the teens are actively helping make life a bit better for others in their community.</p>
<p>Service is <span class="tooltip">valuable<span><strong>Valuable:</strong> important or having worth</span></span>. People volunteer or serve others without expecting money or gifts in return. Service is not just collecting money to give to a group. It is about action and contributing to the <span class="tooltip">common good<span><strong>Common Good:</strong> the greatest possible conditions of society for the greatest number of people living in it</span></span>. The people who serve as well as those who receive help benefit in many ways that are more important than money or gifts. For example, a soup kitchen provides essential food to people who may otherwise go hungry. The soup kitchen is extremely valuable for people and their families who are struggling to get enough to eat.</p>
