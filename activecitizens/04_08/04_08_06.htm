<h1>What Happened in <em>Bush v. Gore</em>?</h1> 
<p>Florida's state-level Supreme Court ordered yet another recount by hand in disputed counties. It said to include counts of ballots that poll workers discarded before because they were not clear. With such close results, including ballots not counted before could change the results. George Bush believed this violated election laws under the U.S. Constitution. He asked the <span class="tooltip">U.S. Supreme Court<span><strong>U.S. Supreme Court:</strong> the name for the highest court in the United States, or court of last resort, hears cases related to the U.S. Constitution</span></span> to review the situation.</p>

<p>On December 12, 2000, over a month after Election Day, the Supreme Court settled the issue. It decided that the Florida Supreme Court did violate the Constitution with its decision to order a new recount. The majority of justices said that though the idea itself was fair, the methods used in the recount were not. Each county used different methods to recount and had different voting practices.</p>
<p>The justices agreed that this was a unique situation. They specifically stated that the decision would apply to this case only and not to future cases. This was the first time the Supreme Court had made this type of statement. Usually decisions serve as a precedent in future cases.</p>
