<p>"Product" can refer to a good or service. Goods are items you buy, like apples or shirts. A service is work done for you, like hairstyling.  Individuals, businesses, and governments use their resources to create products. All four types of resources are needed to produce goods and servicesâ€”land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. <span class="tooltip">Industries<span><strong>Industry:</strong> organized activity related to the production of a specific product or range of products</span></span> are the activities related to creating the products of a country. For example, a paper industry would include wood grinding, access to water, and people to run the equipment.</p>
<p>A country may have enough resources to meet its own needs. However, it can obtain other products it wants  through trade. Other countries may be able to produce the same products faster, better, or for less cost. A country will try to maximize the benefits to its own people in making agreements to <span class="tooltip">import<span><strong>Import:</strong> a good or service transported in from another country</span></span> or <span class="tooltip">export<span><strong>Export:</strong> a good or service transported out to another country</span></span> products.</p>
<p>For example, coffee is a popular drink in the United States. However, the climate is not ideal for growing coffee beans. The country must import its coffee beans from countries like Mexico and Brazil. It may be possible to grow coffee beans in certain areas or with special conditions, but it would be too costly when compared with buying them from a country that specializes in coffee beans.</p>

<p>What countries produce the things you own? Look around your home for product labels. Clothes and electronics are good places to start. Mark on the map in your CAP file the countries you find represented in your home!</p>
