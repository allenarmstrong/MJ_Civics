<h2>Option C: Read an Article</h2>
<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Find and read an article about an ecological issue in your area. You may find an article online or in a newspaper. Ask a trusted adult for help finding an article.</li>
      <li>Summarize your article in at least two well-written paragraphs. Include the article (or how to find it) in a file with your summary. In your summary, be sure to answer the following questions:<br /><br />
        What is the issue?<br />
        How is it an ecological issue?<br />
        How does it relate to conservation?<br />
        Why is it a problem in your area?<br />
        How is the government involved in this issue?<br />
        What can citizens do to help?</li>
      <li>Use a map to identify the area(s) in your local community affected by your chosen issue. You may use the map you created for your CAP file. Save your image to your computer.</li>
      <li>Make sure to save your article to one file to turn in.</li>
    </ol>
