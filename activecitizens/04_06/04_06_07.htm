<h1>What Happened in the <em>United States v. Nixon</em>?</h1>
<p>President Richard Nixon was elected in 1968. He ran for re-election to the presidency in 1972. That year, burglars broke into one of the campaign offices for the candidate who was running against Nixon. The burglars seemed to be looking for information that would have helped the Nixon campaign. Many suspected Nixon's campaign was involved, so Congress assigned an investigator to determine if Nixon or his <span class="tooltip">advisors<span><strong>Advisor:</strong> a person who gives advice</span></span> knew about the burglary. It was discovered that some of Nixon's advisors had connections to the burglars. Eventually, a staff member revealed that Nixon had a recording system installed in the White House to record all conversations. The investigator issued a <span class="tooltip">subpoena<span><strong>Subpoena:</strong> a legal order demanding evidence</span></span> to obtain the recorded conversations Nixon had with his advisors. In response, Nixon released text <span class="tooltip">transcripts<span><strong>Transcript:</strong> a written record</span></span> of the recordings with some pieces missing. The investigator asked a judge to force Nixon to turn over all of the recordings, without missing information.</p>
<p>Nixon argued that a president has the right to keep all discussions with his advisors private and out of the courts. The investigator argued that the tapes were necessary evidence in the case against the burglars.</p>
<p>In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that the president did have a limited <span class="tooltip">executive privilege<span><strong>Executive privilege:</strong> the right of the president and other officials in the executive branch to withhold certain information from Congress or the courts</span></span>. Nixon could keep his communications private, unless the information was critical to a court procedure. The president must obey a court order to release information. The decision showed that though the president did have certain privileges, he is not above the law. A president still must answer to the people for his or her actions.</p>
