<h2><em>United States v. Nixon</em> Text Version</h2>
<p>United States v. Nixon, this is a United States Supreme Court case, which limited the power of the U.S. president or clarified the limitations of the power of the U.S. president. The factual background was, in the 1972 election between president Nixon and George McGovern, the democratic candidate. There was an incident where there was a burglary at the democratic headquarters at the Watergate Complex in the Washington, D.C., area. As a result of this burglary there was an investigation, there was a special prosecutor appointed to investigate this matter. And ultimately the special prosecutor subpoenaed records from the Whitehouse; from president Nixon, asking for tapes and documents that would show communication and/or conversation between president Nixon and some of the individuals that were indicted for that burglary.</p>
<p>President Nixon and his council for president Nixon were issued a subpoena to produce tapes and records showing these conversations. President Nixon asserted what is known as the executive privilege, saying that "as president I should not be required to respond to this subpoena."  The United States Supreme Court reviewed this case and ruled that the president was not exempted from this subpoena by way of executive privilege. In this decision of U.S. v. Nixon, it basically again reiterated the limitations of the executive branch, and it reinforced the separation of powers between the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch.</p>
