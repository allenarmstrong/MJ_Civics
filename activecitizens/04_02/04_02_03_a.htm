<h2><em>Marbury vs. Madison</em> Text Version</h2>
<p>You've asked me about the case of <em>Marbury vs. Madison</em>. That's also known as the case of the midnight judges. It was a contest between John Adams, who was our second president, and Thomas Jefferson, who became our third president.</p>
<p>And in that election, Thomas Jefferson won. John Adams was not happy that Thomas Jefferson won the election. He decided that he was going to go ahead and appoint judges, federal judges before he left office and that their appointment would, basically, not be liked by Thomas Jefferson. It was required though, in order for their appointment to become finalized, that they had to receive certain documentation before the new president took his oath of office. Some did, some didn't. So when Thomas Jefferson came into office, he basically would not acknowledge the judges who did not receive the proper documentation.</p>
<p>So there became a court case known as <em>Marbury vs. Madison</em>. Marbury was one of the judges, or guys that wanted to be a judge who was not going to be a judge because Thomas Jefferson would not acknowledge the validity of his appointment.</p>
<p>So what happened in <em>Marbury vs. Madison</em>, the United States Supreme Court, for the first time in United States history, ruled that a law was unconstitutional. And the significance of this is it really showed the separation of powers between the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch.</p>
