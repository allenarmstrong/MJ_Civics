<h2>Interview with Mileidys Text Version</h2>
<p>[Interviewer] Pleaese introduce yourself.</p>
<p>[Mileidys] My name is Mileidys Ayrers. I was born in Cuba and I came to the United States when I was eight years old.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] Why did you choose to become a U.S. citizen?</p>
<p>[Mileidys] I choose to become a U.S. citizen because this is my home. I believe in the constitution and the rights each individual is given in this country.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] What was the process like?</p>
<p>[Mileidys] The process was actually very interesting. When I became a citizen I was older. For me it was more of a review of the constitution and the amendments.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] What was the most memorable or gratifying part of the process for you?</p>
<p>[Mileidys] For me the most memorable part was, like I said before I was older, so my children were able to be part of the process with me. They were able to attend the oath ceremony with me and watch me go through the whole process.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] So a bit special for them?</p>
<p>[Mileidys] Yes.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] How are you involved in your community?</p>
<p>[Mileidys] I'm involved in my community through my profession and as well through my children's school. I am a teacher, which is my profession. Through my children's school I volunteer in their classrooms to help each of the children. I go through reading activities or some math activities, whichever area they need the most help in.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] How does this activity benefit people?</p>
<p>[Mileidys] Through my profession as an educator, I am able to make a special impact on  children's life. Through my children's school I get to be a part of their education and their school and their classroom and I am able to help other children as well in whatever area they need assistance with.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] That's good. What inspired you to get involved?</p>
<p>[Mileidys] Well, actually I have to say that one of the reasons I became a teacher myself was because of the teachers here. Who had a huge influence in me. Who took a special interest in a child who did not know English and pushed me to be the best I could be. Educators have always had a special place in my heart. As a result, I want to give back the support and the encouragement they gave me, I want to give back to the community.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] What would you say to encourage others to volunteer in their communities?</p>
<p>[Mileidys] I'm a true believer that it does take a village to raise a child. We all have something, a skill, or just love and compassion for each other to inspire children to do their best.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] Thank you very much!</p>
