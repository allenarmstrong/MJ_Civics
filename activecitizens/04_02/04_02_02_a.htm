  <td valign="top">John Adams appointed several new federal judges before leaving the presidency. Thomas Jefferson would not recognize the judges who did not receive their documentation before he took office as the new president. One of the appointed judges asked the Supreme Court to order his documents delivered so he could take his new post based on a law called the Judiciary Act of 1789. </td>
  <td valign="top">The Supreme Court ruled that the law Marbury based his claim on was unconstitutional. This was the first time the court ruled a law as going against the Constitution. It determined that the courts have the power of judicial review.</td>
