        <h1>What Are Some Examples of the Government Types?</h1>
        <p>Each country's government is different from the rest of the world. People in different places have concerns and ways of life that will not exactly match anywhere else. The government types, though, are general enough that they do describe most countries. Usually you would use more than one term to describe a government.</p>
        <p>Try this activity to identify the governments of real countries.</p>

The central government shares powers with the 50 states. It makes decisions that affect all the states though the states maintain separate control over their areas.</p>

              Neighboring nations Mexico and Canada have similar systems to the United States. Both are federations and elect leaders. As a former part of the United Kingdom, Canada still recognizes the monarch. The British monarch chooses a governor-general for Canada who approves laws and people to fill many positions. Mexico has a president that may only serve one six-year term, while the U.S. president may serve two four-year terms.
