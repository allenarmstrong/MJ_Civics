Read each pretend case and answer the questions that follow.</p>
<h3>Scenario 1</h3>
<p>Local law requires that drivers drive no faster than 45 miles per hour on local roads. The law outlines punishments for those who speed. The penalty increases the faster the person travels above the speed limit. The most severe punishments are for those who travel faster than 20 miles per hour above the speed limit.</p>
<p>Signs post this law on most roads, but some sections of roads are missing signs. Local police stop a man traveling 67 miles per hour. He apologizes and insists that he meant no harm. His wife was having a baby and he was anxious to get her quickly to a hospital. The officer gave him a ticket and told him he will have to appear in court since he was going so fast.</p>
<p>Is this a matter of constitutional, criminal, civil, or military law? How do you know? ____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Is the source of the law a statute, regulation, case law, or combination? How do you know? ____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Determine the purpose of the law related to the scenario. Is the law intended to protect people's safety or people's rights? Explain your response and thoughts on what could happen if the law did not exist. _____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Do you think the new father has a valid argument that he should not have received a ticket? In other words, should government change the law or make an exception? Explain the reasons behind your response. ____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<h3>Scenario 2</h3>
<p>State law recognizes that the owner of a vehicle is the person or company whose name appears on the title, or legal and official ownership document. The state also recognizes payment agreements that people and businesses make through official, legal means.</p>
<p>A young woman says her neighbor agreed to purchase her old car. She agreed to accept payments from him on a monthly basis until he paid off the car and trusted that he would honor this plan. She signed ownership over to him on the title, which he also signed. She says that he has not made any payments and still has possession of the car. </p>
<p>The neighbor says he understood the car to be a gift and has no obligation to make payments. He did not sign an official agreement to make payments. He says that she gave him the car in exchange for his electric scooter, which is new and gets great gas mileage. The neighbor maintains she just wants the car back now that he fixed it and it looks better.</p>

<p>Do you think the young woman has a valid argument that her neighbor owes her payment for the car? In other words, should government make an exception to the law about the owner being the person whose name is on the title?

<h3>Scenario 3</h3>
<p>Federal law requires that news agencies not publish or broadcast information that could threaten the security of the nation's armed forces in times of conflict. However, the Constitution protects the right to free expression of ideas. Judges use past decisions on cases where the law and rights come into conflict to settle similar disputes. In one case, <em>New York Times vs. United States</em>, the Supreme Court decided that a newspaper could publish information about the military that the president said should remain secret to protect the troops. The justices said the president failed to prove that the information could threaten the nation's security.</p>
<p>Federal officials accuse an online newspaper of violating the law against publishing secret information about the military. One of their reporters posted comments online about her friend, whom is a soldier serving overseas. On her personal website, she posted a picture of him, where he is stationed, and negative opinions of his commanders, including the president. The newspaper insists that the reporter did this on her own time and that the newspaper is not responsible. The reporter maintains that whether at work or not, she has the right to express her opinions freely under the Constitution.</p>
<p>U.S. government officials say that the posting of the information could put the soldier in harm's way. Officials also say that her negative opinions could encourage others to stop supporting the soldiers and break laws in protest. They insist that as a reporter for the newspaper, people could believe that her ideas were those of everyone working for the newspaper. They say the newspaper and the reporter have threatened the safety and security of the armed forces.</p>
