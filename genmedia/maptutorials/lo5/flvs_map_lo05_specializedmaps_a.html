<h2>Specialized Maps</h2>
<p>Lesson 1 of 7:</p>
<p>Screen 1 of 2:</p>
<p>This animation shows a series of cartograms, which are maps that show statistics as they relate between land areas. Notice that as the maps change by year, North America increases in size. This is because the North American Population increased as a portion of the total world population. Cartograms distort land shape on purpose to display information.<br />
  (Image titled in the bottom left corner &quot;Share of the World Population&quot;. Image depicts the world map, with North America and Europe positioned at the top edge. The image is interactive and changes with time. Beginning with year one, we see North, Central, and South America depicted as very thin land masses compared to present day form. Europe, Asia and Africa are also seen but are depicted similar to their present day form. As year one fades out year 1500 fades in and we can see North, Central, and South America increase in size. Europe, and Africa increase in size slightly and Asia slightly decreases. Next in 1900 we see again that the America's increase in size and we see Europe increase in size quite noticeably. Africa and Asia decrease in size slightly. Finally in 1960 we see growth from all areas on the map except Asia, and Europe which decreases in size quite noticeably. The image then fades into screen 2 showing additional text)</p>
<p>Screen 2 of 2:</p>
<p>Cartograms and other specialized maps can challenge our mental maps, or the way we think of the world around us and picture it in our minds. These challenges encourage us to learn more about the information displayed on the map.<br />
  (Image uses the same elements as Screen 1 and displays the 1960 image.)<br />

<h2>Historical and Dot Density Maps</h2>
  Lesson 2 of 7:</p>
<p>Examine the image to learn about historical maps, which represent Earth’s features at a previous point in time, and dot-density maps, which show the frequency of a specific item or event over a geographic area.<br />
  (Image is a map of the United States, the map is titled “Cropland Harvested Acreage, 1949”, and a yellow circle is placed here to show a “hot spot”. There is also a key stating 1 dot is equal to 25,000 acres. The maps land mass is colored green, with the exception of a number of black dots covering much of the central and northeastern states and spread thinly across the rest of the states. A yellow circle marks another hot spot where the black dots seem to be the thickest, just to the northwest border of Iowa)</p>
<p>Rollover the hotspots in the image for more information:<br />
  Hot Spot Description: <br />
  Cropland Harvested Acreage, 1949: Notice a cartographer produced this map in the past. Historical Maps are useful for learning about an area and future planning in many industries. Historical Maps are based on a previous point in time.<br />
  Hotspot by dots on map:  This is a dot-density map showing the frequency of a specific item or event over a geographic area. This area is very dense with dots indicating many more acres of land harvested here than other areas.<br />

  <h2> More on Historical Maps</h2>
  Lesson 3 of 7:</p>
<p>When we study history, we may be interested in maps made by past cartographers. These maps are historical artifacts produced at the time the map represents. Historical maps made in the past often contain many inaccuracies. They teach us about how people viewed their world and the information they had.<br />
  (Image is a historical map titled “1950 Map of Florida. The map looks nothing like present day Florida. Here we can see that the cartographer shows Florida as a “V”, and is not as large as it should be in height. There is a body of water in the northern area of Florida. We can also see 3 islands to the right of Florida, which are not named)<br />

   <h2>Contour Maps:</h2>
  
  Lesson 4 of 7:</p>
<p>Examine these images to understand contour maps, which show elevation of Earth’s surface.<br />
  (Image has two map element. <br />
  The top map shows a section of land from above and we can see there are different colors to the land. Moving from the outer edge inwards we see the outer edges of the shape are green, next we see a brown which appears as a figure 8 on its side. Inside the figure 8 are two areas shaded with different grays. On the left is a dark gray ring with a medium gray dot. On the right we see a dark gray ring, then medium gray ring, and a light gray dot. The map is divided by a horizontal white line labeled A on the left and B on the right. There are also numbers labeled on the edges of the different colors. Green is 10, brown is 20, dark gray is 30, medium gray is 40 and light gray is 50. The rings are not perfect in shape, and we see there is a series of vertical lines used to show the distance between the edges of each color.</p>
<p>The bottom image is a side view of the same land mass and here we can see that this appears to be a mountain range. The map is labeled A on the left, B on the right and we can see that the numbers are listed as well on each side, 50 on top, 40, 30, 20, 10 and finally 0 on the bottom. A horizontal line cuts across the image connecting each number from A side to its match on the B side. The same colors are also on the map green is 10 on the bottom, brown is next 20, dark gray 30, medium gray 40, and light gray 50.)</p>
<p>Rollover the hotspots in the image for more information:<br />
  Hot Spot Description:<br />
  Top image: Contour maps show elevation, meaning the height above or below sea level. They also show topography, meaning the land features of an area.<br />
  Bottom Image: Imagine making a perfectly horizontal slice across a mountain. The outline of the mountain’s cut edge would be one contour line on the map. Imagine making more cuts at equal distances to understand the creation of a contour map.<br />

<h2>Choropleth Maps</h2></p><br />
  Lesson 5 of 7:<br />
  Choropleth maps use color to display information such as climate and weather information. Examine the image for an example.<br />
  (Image is a map titled “Choropleth Map of India’s Climate”. A map key shows the following descriptions; Pink – Highland, Aqua – Humid Subtropical, Light Green – Tropical Wet, Dark Green – Tropical Wet, Tan – Arid, Orange – Semi-Arid. Four of the main states are titled; Rajasthan in the northwest, Assam in the northeast, Madhya Pradesh in the center, and Kerala on the southwest coast. Rajasthan is mostly tan with some orange borders to the east. North of this state we see some pink and aqua, making up part of Madhya Pradesh, the rest of this state to the south is mostly light green with a strip of orang extending from the center of the state to the southernmost tip. Kerala is to the southwest of Madhya Pradesh and is mostly green. Finally in the north east we find Assam and it is mostly aqua, with exception of some pink in the north.)</p>
<p>Rollover the hotspots in the image for more information:<br />
  Hot spot in Rajasthan: This map uses color to show the extent of climate areas in India. Notice that arid or dry areas, like the state of Rajasthan, are covered in tan.<br />
  Hot spot in Kerala: Most of India is very humid. For example, the state of Kerala has a wet, tropical climate, and therefore it is colored dark green. Kerala often experiences flooding during the rainy monsoon months of June to October.<br />

 <h2>GIS and GPS Mapping</h2></p><br />
  Lesson 6 of 7:<br />
  GPS, or Global Positioning System, uses satellite technology developed for the military to locate a precise coordinate point for someone or something. GIS, or Global Information System, is sets of descriptive or scientific data for a place.<br />
  Cartographers can use GPS and GIS separately or together to create accurate maps useful in many areas. Drivers, pilots, hiker, and boaters use GPS to navigate and avoid collisions. Researchers and travellers use GIS to study scientific of feature information for a place.<br />
  (Image of a map showing land, water and roadways. Ocala National Forrest is labeled in the upper left corner, at the bottom of the map a roadway labeled as Country Rd. 445 moving diagonally from the middle of the map to the right. A location is pointed out on the map by a black dot called by Alexander Springs. Another roadway moves up from Country Rd. 445 and loops back on itself, here there is a red pin. A white info bubble appears above the pin and states “Alexander Springs Lat. 29.07889 Long. -81.58.” The bubble also shows another image of the location itself, a photograph. The location is a light blue body of water, surrounded by trees and foliage, with white sand on one shore. )<br />
  GPS tells us “where.” GPS gives the latitude and longitude coordinate point, or absolute location, for Alexander Springs on this map. GIS, on the other hand, tells us “what.” GIS would tell us about Alexander Springs’ characteristics, such as water depth or native plants.<br />

<p>Images:</p>
<p>(Image 1; Shows a map with the original 13 colonies which made up the United States in the upper right. Below we see the state of Florida, and to the left what appears to be the lower half of California. These areas are all colored green and separated from each other. They are connected by a blue body of land which appears to be shaped like the rest of the United States before the country’s completion. The green land is much larger by ratio than the blue land.)<br />
  (Image 2; Shows a map of Florida and its bordering states, they are all colored green. There are dark spots covering the map, and some areas are much darker in than others around it.)<br />
  (Image 3; Shows a map of Australia, which has the shape of an arch. Australia appears as having a peninsula pointing south on its southeastern shore, and another appears on its northeastern shore pointing firs north, then northwest.)<br />
  (Image 4; Shows a map of the United States. In the southwest the map is colored red, the southeast is yellow, red and yellow meet in the middle of Texas. Just north of the yellow the map is colored green, which also meets the red at the northern tip of Texas. Above the red and green is light blue this color covers much of the northern half of the country from coast to coast. A darker blue appears in some areas of the lighter blue and also in some of the northern and northeastern states. A key states red is hot-dry, yellow is hot-humid, green is mixed-humid, blue is cold, and dark blue is very cold.)<br />
  (Image 5; Shows a map with a number of different colored shapes, all of different sizes. There is an outer circle or ring of dark brown and as we move inwards the shapes get smaller. Within this shape is another lighter brown, then a dark tan, then light tan, and a beige dot. Each color has a number on its edge dark brown 10, light brown 20, dark tan 30, light tan 40, beige 50.)<br />
  (Image 6; Shows a map with a number of named roads and symbols to show special interest buildings, there is a blue road running horizontally across the map and it crosses over another road that is marked in red. Just to the right of where these two roads cross, there is a red arrow pointing to the blue road.)</p>
