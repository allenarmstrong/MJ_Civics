<h2>Preamble Text Version</h2>
<p>"We the people of the United States,"</p>
<p>Narrator: The preamble, or introduction, of the Constitution, explains why the Constitution was written. "We the people" emphasizes that the people developed the government and that the government exists for the people.</p>
<p>"in Order to form a more perfect Union,"</p>
<p>Narrator: The states sometimes had conflicting interests. There needed to be a way for disagreements to be resolved without states going to war with one another.</p>
<p>"establish Justice,"</p>
<p>Narrator: The Founding Fathers believed a good government would require a strong but fair system of justice.</p>
<p>"insure domestic Tranquility,"</p>
<p>Narrator: Tranquility means "free from commotion." Ensuring domestic tranquility means maintaining peace within the nation.</p>
<p>"provide for the common defence,"</p>
<p>Narrator: The Framers worried about threats from European countries, rebellion, and possible attacks from Native Americans. They needed a military that could protect all states.</p>
<p>"promote the general Welfare,"</p>
<p>Narrator: Because people do not always act for the good of the community on their own free will, the government is necessary to keep order.</p>
<p>"and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,"</p>
<p>Narrator: The Revolutionary War was fought to restore the liberties that the British had taken away. The Framers wanted to emphasize the fact that the new government would protect liberties, not just in their lives, but for future generations as well.</p>
<p>"do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."</p>
<p>Narrator: The Constitution was authorized and established as the law of the land.</p>
