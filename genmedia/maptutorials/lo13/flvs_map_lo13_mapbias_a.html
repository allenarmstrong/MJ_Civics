   <h2>How can bias affect how we make and read maps?</h2>
   <p>Lesson 1 of 5:</p>
   <p>A bias is any personal judgment about people, places, or things. Bias can be as simple as preferring blue over green. Everyone has biases.
     Sometimes we do not have a logical reason for a bias. Regardless, biases affect how cartographers create maps and how we read them.
     Examine this interactive image for examples of map bias. The questions related to the image have no right answer but depend on what you think about the map.
     (Image is a map showing some of Earth's continents. The map is titled "The American's Worldview", and has a scale of 1 inch to equal 600 miles. We can see North and Central America, and we see portions of South America, Africa and Europe. The map is colored gray with the exception of the United States. The U.S. appears to be colored in with the national flag, waving in the wind. The U.S. outline appears to be slightly larger in relation to other countries. A Statue of Liberty also appears on the eastern U.S. We see a number of arrows and labels for countries and bodies of water, they are: "Nation of Geese & Hockey," "Great Britain or England or Something," "Spicy Food & Sombreros," "American Ocean!!!" Hotspots appear on each of the labels or images.)</p>

  <h2 class="textOnly">Hotspot Descriptions:</h2>
  <p class="textOnly"><br />
    National Flag: <br />
    Notice how only the United States appears in color. It is more exciting to look at, drawing your attention, and using the colors of the national flag. Why do you think only the United States is in color?<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Statue of Liberty: <br />
    Notice how the cartographer chose a specific U.S. landmark to highlight in this map but none from other regions. Choice of image to use for a symbol and what the symbols represent indicate bias. What do the symbols tell you about the purpose of the map?<br />
    <br />
<br />
    Nation of Geese &amp; Hockey: <br />
    Notice that the cartographer chose to include land beyond the United States in this map, but not to display it in the same manner. What kind of interpretation might be shown here?<br />
    <br />
<br />
    Great Britain or England or Something: <br />
    The titles for other nations are inaccurate. How does this affect the map? The text a cartographer chooses to include on a map, as well as what is omitted, is done on purpose to meet the goals of the map.<br />
    <br />
<br />
    Spicy Food &amp; Sombreros: <br />
    The titles for other nations are inaccurate. How does this affect how you interpret the map? The text a cartographer chooses to include on a map, as well as what is omitted, is done on purpose to meet the goals of the map.<br />
    <br />
<br />
    American Ocean: <br />
    Notice the cartographer used an inaccurate scale. We know the United States is not that large in relation to other nations. The cartographer controls the scale as well as whether it is consistent throughout.<br />
    <br />
<br />
    Historical maps may not have accurate scale because of lack of knowledge or technology to make accuracy possible. Remember, the smaller the scale, the less detail the cartographer can show. Cartographers omit more information from maps as scale decreases to keep it readable.</p>

  <h2>Why Bias?</h2>
  <p>Lesson 2 of 5:</p>
    <p>
      Maps, like historical documents, need to be understood in terms of the context of their creation. Context information tells you a lot about bias in the map. The questions listed on the right can help you determine what type of biases are in the map and why.
      Try this activity to see how bias affects different maps of the same location.
      (Image is a bullet list of questions)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who was the author?    </li>
      <li>Who is the intended audience?    </li>
      <li>Why was it created?    </li>
      <li>How was it created?    </li>
      <li>When was it created?    </li>

    <h3>Question 1 of 4:    </h3>
    <p>Which map was created long ago by hand for early residents?<br />
      <br />
Map "A": (Image of an angled, "point of view" map of a town. There is a church in the upper right corner and appears to be fenced in with a large brick wall and buildings around the main structure. There is also a large garden and pond in the court yard of the church. In the upper left section, there is a road with buildings and they each have a small garden. There is a boulevard of trees between this street and the next. They both connect in front of the church. In the center of town there is another block of buildings with a large shared garden or yard and we see there is a blue bus route which travels up the right side of the block, "North England Street". It then reaches the front of the church and back down the left side of the block.)
      <br />
      <br />
      Map "B": (Image of a town map. There appear to be lots separated and divided to show ownership. There are some streets or roadways running left to right, and other roads or alleys between them. A rusty colored square is used to mark buildings, most appear along the middle street running left to right.)
      <br />
      <br />
      Map "C": (Image of a town map, showing similar features as map "B" but larger details. The map is black and white except for 3 buildings which are colored red and have circles around them; the three buildings are businesses called Prentice Store, Bakery, and Tarpleys Store. There are a number of other businesses along this street such as a post office, a silversmith, a blacksmith, a wigmaker, an apothecary; there are 4 taverns as well. To the bottom of the map we see there are locations for colonial houses and residence hall registration.)
      <br />
      <br />
      Map "D": (Image of a town map. This map is in black and white, with a map key showing 4 zones and a pattern to show their areas. North Zone is left blank with no line patterns; the South Zone is a dotted pattern. The East Zone is showing with a wide horizontal line, and the West Zone with a thin horizontal line pattern. There is a railroad track shown rounding the north east corner of the town. The different zones divide the center of the town. To the south of the divided zones we see a number of large buildings, with roadways or parking lots.)
      <br />

  <h2>Analysis of Bias</h2>
    <p>Lesson 3 of 5:</p>
    <p>All maps have bias. This does not make them useless but rather more fascinating for study and comparisons. Every choice a cartographer makes in creating a map introduces bias. When you study a map, you will get more information from it by considering the possible biases in the map.
    <br />
    <br />
    You should also consider your own biases. How do your experiences and knowledge affect how you read the map? How do the biases in the map affect how you will use it?
    <br />
    <br />
    (Image of a map of Florida, titled "Nuevo Mundo". The map is a very old representation of Florida as it is shaped like a "V" and does not have a long stretching coastline. There are images of gold coins on the northwestern, southeastern and northeastern coasts. There is also a fountain of youth labeled on the northeast coast. We also see that there is a dot on the southwest coast, and a dotted line travelling out into the water to the south and travelling to one of 3 islands to the east of Florida. Here there is a red "X" which may mean that there is treasure buried here.)

  <h2>Bias all around us:</h2>
  <p>Lesson 4 of 5:</p>
    <p>Biased maps are common in our daily lives. They are useful for a variety of needs. An example is a bus route map. The route may not show all the places you may be interested in stopping at, but it does show you the critical bus information you need to get to a location. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Another common example is when a company produces a map showing a company produces a map showing all its locations. Though similar businesses may exist nearby, they would not appear in order to encourage you to visit the company that is on the map.
    <br />
    <br />
    (Image is a bus route map being held in someone's hand. We can see that the bus has accessibility for disabled persons; there is information about the start of the route and other stops along its route such as time and connecting routes. There is also a map key and a compass rose showing the direction of north on this route map it is pointing to the top edge of the map.)

  <h2>Self-Check</h2>
  <p>Lesson 5 of 5:</p>
    You should now be familiar with map bias. Try this activity to check your understanding.<br />
    <br />
    Question 1 of 8:<br />

      <li>True</li>
      <li>False</li>
     </ol> Image of a map of Australia titled &quot;Aboriginal Australia – Map of the different aboriginal groups throughout Australia&quot;. A map scale shows 1 inch is equal to 500 miles. A key is also shown with a color pattern of blue, green, yellow and pink representing the aboriginal groups; a red line shows that it will define regions. There is a footnote stating that borders are estimations. The continent is divided into 16 regions and throughout each region we see they are broken down even more by many of the group colors.)</h2>
