            <h2>Identify the issue</h2>
            
            <p>What is the problem? Why is it a problem? To answer these questions, stay on the alert in your community. Pay attention to the local news and to what people are concerned about it your area. The issue should be one that needs government action. For example, a public playground with damaged equipment is a better choice than your neighbor's overgrown yard because local government can act to rebuild the playground.</p></div>
            
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p><img style="float:right;" src="../../../sharingpower/03_08/images/03_08_07_dumpster.png" />Mandy lives in Florida. She discovered a feral cat colony near her favorite restaurant. She is concerned for the cats there. She heard on the news that cats living in the wild can spread disease. Her parents mentioned their worry that the cats may get into the restaurant's kitchen and spread their germs where food is stored or cooked. Some visitors to the restaurant are angry. They find the cats laying or eating on their cars in the parking lot. A cat bit a woman, who needed treatment at the hospital. They want the restaurant owner to get rid of the cats. The owner says it is the county government's responsibility. The cats do not belong to him.</p>

             <h2>Conduct Background Research</h2>
           
            <p>Learn as much as you can about the issue. Find out what government is doing to solve the problem. Find out what citizen groups are doing for the issue. Find out what people are saying about the issue. Who will help you make a plan? You can find information by talking with trusted adults, researching newspapers and local organizations, listening to local radio, and searching local government websites. Are you able to find any laws or policies that are addressing the issue?</p>

            <h2>Identify the Solution and Criteria</h2>
            <p>What is your goal, or what do you expect to happen? Once you settle on a solution, it's time to determine the criteria. Criteria are the characteristics you will use to judge possible public policy changes to address your issue. Using a single set of criteria will help you choose the best public policy alternative. What will your public policy need to have for other people and leaders to support it?</p>

			<p>No matter what issue you choose, there are common criteria to consider as you evaluate public policy alternatives.  Government leaders and the public are more likely to support policies that are cost effective, relatively easy to begin, and supported by many in the community. Funds for public policy have to come from local or state government. Officials in charge of deciding where to spend money will support a plan that will have the most impact for what they spend. Public policy alternatives that are more difficult to carry out may be less likely to get support. Since people in the community pay taxes, they will support sending their money to ideas they like. You might choose additional criteria specific to your issue.</p>
			</div>
            
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p><img width="100" style="float:right;" src="../../../sharingpower/03_08/images/03_08_07_phone.png" />Mandy recognized that the feral cat colony is a problem because of the health concerns and anger of restaurant visitors. Her solution is to reduce the feral colony population. Mandy knows that the public policy alternative she seeks to meet this goal must be cost effective. She knows it must be relatively easy to carry out and that many people in her community must support it.</p>

            <h2>Identify All Public Policy Alternatives</h2>
            
            <p>What possible rules could government enact to address the problem? What else can government do? What has been tried? A great way to find this information is through the news or government websites. Remember, most local governments and all state governments have websites where you can find information on public policies, laws, and departments or agencies. Visiting the department or agency websites, or calling them, can help you identify what policies have been tried or considered. Talk to trusted adults for help with this information, such as a parent or your instructor.</p>
          </div>
            
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p><img width="100" style="float:right;" src="../../../sharingpower/03_08/images/03_08_07_computer.png" />Mandy's research included talking to her local animal control office.  She visited the website of the county's animal shelter. She learned about three possible public policy options to reduce the feral cat population in her area. They are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>TNR (Trap-Neuter-Release) – a program where feral cats are captured and spayed or neutered. This means their ability to have kittens is surgically removed. Then they are returned to the colony, but they can no longer produce new kittens. Volunteers also feed the feral cats in the hope of reducing their hunting of endangered species.</li>
                <li>Adoption or euthanizing – a program through the animal shelter where workers capture and observe the feral cats. Cats that would make good pets are put up for adoption and those that would not are euthanized.</li>
                <li>Education – making great effort to spread the word about the problem with feral cat colonies. The purpose is to encourage cat owners to spay or neuter their pets, keep them inside, and not abandon them. Changing people's behavior could help prevent growth of the colony and even reduce it.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ui_slide">
            <div class="explanation">
            <h2>Evaluate the public policy alternatives </h2>
            
            <p>Do the possible solutions meet your judging criteria? What are the possible positive and negative aspects of each action? What do other people say about the possible solutions? </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p><img width="150" style="float:right;" src="../../../sharingpower/03_08/images/03_08_07_humane.png" />Mandy spoke to trusted adults in the community to estimate the costs of each public policy alternative. She knows that people in her area will not support any plan that would harm the cats. Many people in the area bring food to the colony. Her local official said he would not support any plan that may be against existing laws. Mandy found that other officials would not support the TNR program, though many people do support it. It does prevent the cats from naturally increasing their numbers. However, it is costly and there is no proof that it slows or stops the cats from hunting wildlife. The shelter's program has a lot of resistance from Mandy's fellow citizens. The idea of euthanizing the cats upset many of them. However, the local animal control office believes this is the best solution. Mandy found that no one objects to the education solution. It was very low in cost. Yet officials doubt that education will be enough to reduce the colony. As long as cats continue to join the colony through births and abandonment, the population will not go down. Mandy watched a webcast of her county council meeting where one official said that it was worth trying, though, and better than doing nothing.</p>

            <h2>Choose the best public policy alternative</h2>
            
            <p>From your evaluation, which is the best public policy alternative to address the problem? What makes it the best choice? Keep in mind you are not likely to find a perfect public policy. Evaluating the alternatives means choosing the policy most likely to bring the best results toward solving the problem.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p><img style="float:right;" src="../../../sharingpower/03_08/images/03_08_07_adopt.png" />Mandy discovered that each policy has positive and negative sides. Her solution to the feral cats issue was to reduce the population. She knew people were concerned about the effects of the feral cats on health and the environment. Mandy evaluated the public policy options through talking with people and researching costs. She then decided that the best alternative was to educate people in the community. Mandy believes that if more people know about it, more will come together. They could agree on ways to address the issue. People will be less likely to act in ways that increases the colony population. She believes education is the best cost-effective, easy-to-start policy that will reduce the feral colony population.</p>

            <h2>Make your citizen action plan</h2>
            
            <p>Now that you have chosen the best public policy alternative, it's time to develop a possible plan to get your policy choice enacted. To make a new policy or a change in policy, leaders in local or state government have to make the change. The most important part of the plan will be contacting officials who can make the policy a reality. How could you get their attention? How could you convince them to make your policy choice official? You could contact officials, and ask others who support your idea to do the same. You could get more support in the community through writing to the news or radio stations. You could request to appear at a local government meeting. You could ask the leaders of the departments or agencies to support your idea and discuss it with those who make policy decisions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p><img width="100" style="float:right;" src="../../../sharingpower/03_08/images/03_08_07_speech.png" />Mandy made an outline of her citizen action plan. She included writing a letter to her local officials and the newspaper. The letter would describe her policy idea to educate the community about the feral cats. She thought she could ask the local animal control officer to meet with county council members to discuss the idea. She also listed appearing before the county council with the animal shelter manager. There she could explain how sending information to each home in the community could reduce the problem. She could mention the low cost of the policy. Mandy could describe how her plan includes advertisements in newspapers and on local television, and mailing information to each home. The mail booklets would focus on the importance of spaying or neutering pets and not abandoning pets to the wild. Mandy thinks she could convince a few officials by explaining that less feral cats would mean less risk to public health and fewer people upset about them. Mandy feels strongly about the issue. She will talk to her parents about possibly carrying out her citizen action plan.</p>
