<h1>Should a Deadline Determine Ratification?</h1>
<p>Six amendment ideas have been proposed since 1789 but not been ratified. Congress gave two of those a deadline for ratification. In other words, three-fourths of the states failed to ratify these amendments by a certain date. According to Congress, these two ideas must begin the process again if they are to ever become ratified amendments. For the other four amendment ideas, however, Congress did not specify a deadline. Therefore, the states could still ratify them someday, though the chance is small.</p>
<p>When the Constitution became the law of the United States, 10 amendments were ratified shortly after. We call them the <span class="tooltip">Bill of Rights<span><strong>Bill of Rights:</strong> the first 10 amendments to the Constitution</span></span>. At that time, two other amendment ideas failed. One of them was finally ratified in 1992 and is now the 27th Amendment. This amendment says that if Congress approves a pay raise for its members, the change will not take effect until after the next election. After proposal, 202 years passed before this amendment was ratified!</p>
<p>Some members of Congress believe this amendment should not have passed without additional study, because so much time had passed.</p>
