<h2><em>Gideon v. Wainwright</em> Text Version</h2>
<p><em>Gideon vs. Wainwright</em> was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1963. And basically what happened, there was a man named Clarence Gideon and he was arrested for larceny, like a theft, he went to court and he asked that the judge give him a lawyer to represent him in trial because he could not afford one.</p>
<p>The law at the time in Florida was that the only time an attorney would be appointed would be in a capital case, like maybe where someone was looking at the death penalty. So Mr. Gideon, he wasn't happy with that answer, he wasn't satisfied with that answer. So ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court was asked to decide whether or not, when someone was looking at a criminal offense, and they could not afford an attorney, whether or not an attorney should be appointed to represent them.</p>
<p>And the United States Supreme Court came out and said that someone who is charged with a criminal offense, they should be afforded the right to counsel even if they cannot afford counsel. And since that time in criminal cases if someone cannot afford to hire their own attorney the court will appoint an attorney to represent them.</p>
