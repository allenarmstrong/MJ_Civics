<p><strong>Complete the following story by filling in the spaces with information from the lesson or your imagination where indicated.</strong></p>
<p>Hello, I am a dollar bill. I was printed many years ago, back in _________________________ (a year of your choice). First, I was sent to the _________________________ (central U.S. bank), which is important to the national economy in many ways. One thing it does is _________________________ (a task of the central U.S. bank). This affects the banking system in the United States because _________________________ (how the central U.S. bank <br>
  affects banking throughout the economy). I then was shipped to a bank named <sub></sub>_________________________ (a name of your choice) <br>
  in the city of _________________________ (a U.S. city of your choice). The next thing that happened to me was _________________________ (an action of the bank that transferred the bill to a person) and that's how I ended up in the pocket of a person named _________________________ (a name of your choice). The person wanted me because  (how the person obtained the dollar from a bank and why). <br>
  This person then gave me to  _________________________ (a business of your choice) for _________________________ (describe the good or service purchased). I overheard someone say that the _________________________ _________________________ (glossary term) was being decreased because _________________________ (describe issue in economy that would explain the decrease). This would affect the flow of _________________________ (what moves between people and groups) in the economy because _________________________ (how this flow and the decrease relate). The next thing I knew, I was sent to _________________________ (a bank, business, or government agency of your choice) because _________________________ (reason for the dollar bill to be sent elsewhere). Since then, it's been _________________________ (a number related to the first sentence) years, and I have a lot of wear and tear. It's time for me to enjoy retirement while new dollar bills are sent into the flow. Thanks so much for helping me to tell my story!</p>
