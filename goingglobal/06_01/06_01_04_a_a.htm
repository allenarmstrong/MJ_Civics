<h2>Arrangement of Government: Answers Text Version</h2>
<h3>Slide 1</h3>
<p>Governments also differ in how they manage their political divisions, such as state or local governments. Some of the arrangements are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>unitary</li>
    <li>confederation</li>
    <li>federation</li>
    <li>parliamentary</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Slide 2</h3>
  <p>A <strong>unitary</strong> government makes all major decisions for the whole nation. Smaller units of government, like states or cities, have limited powers and functions. The central government chooses what powers and functions to give them. Most nations of Europe and Africa have unitary governments.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A direct democracy is a form of government where the laws are made directly by the citizens. A true direct democracy would be very difficult to achieve. It would require all citizens to take part in making decisions.</li>
    <li>A representative democracy, or republic, is a government that is run indirectly by the people. This means that the people elect representatives to make decisions for them. We can call the United States a representative democracy or republic.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Image: The national capital is huge in proportion to the state capitals.)</p>
<h3>Slide 3</h3>
<p>A <strong>confederation</strong> is a group of loosely allied states. The central government of the nation is weak. It only has the powers that the individual states agree to give to it. Usually a group of states forms a confederation to meet a specific need, such as for defense or to create a common currency.</p>
<p>(Image: The state capitals is much, much bigger than the national capital. The state capitals are equal in size.)</p>
<h3>Slide 4</h3>
<p>A <strong>federation</strong> is a group of allied states with a powerful central government. The states and central government share powers and functions. The central government cannot take away the states' power to make their own laws. However, it can make laws that affect how each state governs its people.</p>
<p>(Image: The state capitals and national capital are close to equal, though the national capitol is larger.)</p>
  <h3>Slide 5</h3>
  <p>A <strong>parliamentary</strong> government has a legislative branch with authority over the executive branch. Elected members of the legislature choose the executive leader or leaders. Often this leader's title is "prime minister." The prime minister is a member of the legislative branch and answers to that group. He or she is responsible for carrying out decisions of the legislative branch. The prime minister is similar to a president. However, a president is elected by the people. A president answers to the voters, not the legislative branch.</p>
