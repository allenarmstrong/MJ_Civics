								<h1>How Does the Florida Legislature Work?</h1>
								<p>While "Congress" is what we call the national legislature, for each state we say "the state legislature." Like in Congress, Florida's legislature has two sections: the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate.</p>
								<p>Florida has 40 state senators and 120 state representatives. Voters elect members of the legislature, who must live in the district they represent. Those running in the election must be at least 21 years old and a resident of Florida for at least two years. State senators serve four-year terms, while representatives serve two-year terms. In Congress, U.S. senators also have longer terms, six years, to benefit from the experience gained from longer service. However, U.S. senators must be at least 30 years old. U.S. Representatives must be at least 25 years old and serve two-year terms.</p>
								<p>The Florida Legislature meets for a 60-day "session" beginning in March of each year. When the legislators are in session, they debate making new laws or changing old ones. An idea for a law is called a "bill." Members of the legislature meet in committees to study the bills in detail. For example, a bill about students learning civics would likely go to the Senate Education Pre-K–12 Committee. That committee and a similar one in the House would study the bill in detail, edit it, and recommend to the rest of the legislature whether to pass it or drop it.</p>

								<p>Florida students can work for the state legislature! Depending on a student's age, they may assist the legislators with handing out materials, sending messages, and other errands.</p>

																		<h2>How are they similar of different?</h2>
																		<p>The organization and titles of the Florida constitution differ from the U.S. Constitution. However, both create three branches of government. Here we see how each introduces the legislative branch. The U.S. legislative branch is called Congress, while in Florida it is the Florida Legislature. We use the term state legislature to describe this branch in general for any state.</p>
																		<p>The Florida Constitution also creates the offices of the Auditor General and the Commission on Ethics. The Auditor General completes financial and performance audits, or reviews, of various state agencies and their records. The Commission on Ethics is a group of nine appointed people who serve two-year terms. They oversee and write rules for proper behavior of state officials and employees. The commission also investigates complaints against state officials or employees.</p>
