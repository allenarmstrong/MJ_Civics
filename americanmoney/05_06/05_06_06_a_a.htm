<h2>Terms: Answers Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Fill in the blanks with the correct term from the word bank.</p>
<p><strong>Word Bank:</strong>  president, Congress, issues, public, Veterans' Benefits and Services, Natural Resources and Environment, fixed, growth, Non-defense Spending, Congressional Budget Resolution, Community and Regional Development, President's Budget Request, General Government, grant, and mandatory</p>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>President's Budget Request</strong> is the first step in the federal budget process. The <strong>president</strong> outlines changes to the budget, which reflect changes in priorities for the upcoming year. <strong>Congress</strong> debates the changes in the next step, the <strong>Congressional Budget Resolution</strong>. Priorities depend in part on current <strong>issues</strong> important to the <strong>public</strong>. More than half of the budget is made up of <strong>mandatory</strong> spending, meaning those expenses are <strong>fixed</strong>. The category that varies the most is the <strong>Non-defense Spending</strong>.</p>
<p>Expenses in this category affect our everyday lives. If a disaster struck the West Coast, funds to help victims would come from <strong>Community and Regional Development</strong>. Health care for former military comes from <strong>Veterans' Benefits and Services</strong>. Protecting federal land areas for wildlife comes from <strong>Natural Resources and Environment</strong>. The pay for someone who works on staff at the White House would come from <strong>General Government</strong>. Americans disagree on whether increasing federal spending, such as a student <strong>grant</strong> program, leads to general economic <strong>growth</strong>.</p>
