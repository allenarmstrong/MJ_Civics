<h2>Letter Text Version</h2>
<p>Dear Meg,</p>
<p>I know we have been best friends for like a bazillion years or so, but it has been tough lately. I remember playing in the sandbox with you in pre-K. We have been to all of each other's birthday parties. I love you like my sister, and this is so difficult for me to write.</p>
<p>Yet the past few months you have ignored my feelings and our friendship. You did not come to even one of my bowling matches, but I went to all of your softball games. You ignore my texts and pretend you do not see me in public. These things are hurtful to me. When I saw your party invite with a note telling me what I should buy for you, I knew I had had enough.</p>
<p>I can't stay friends with someone who makes me feel so bad. I am sorry, Meg, but from now on I will no longer return your messages, attend your parties, or cheer at your games. I will focus on hanging out with friends who care about me.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>
<p>Samuel</p>
