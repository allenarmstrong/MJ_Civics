    <p>Lesson 1 of 4:</p>
    <p> People make maps often. Examples include military leaders mapping battle plans, historians showing there an event took place and what existed there, professional cartographers mapping data, and students showing they understand the ecology of a region. We can create maps by hand, using simple computer software for images, or even geographic information systems (GIS) data with professional cartography software that can change projection with a button click.
    <br />    
    <p>    Examine this image for example of a mapmaker's tools.<br />
     <br />
     (Image contains a number of elements. We see a piece of paper with rows and columns of data on it, we see two old maps, one rolled up and another rolled out for viewing. A modern map of the world is also laid out, close by. We can also see some of the tools of a cartographer's trade, a pencil, pen, chalk, ruler, a math compass and laptop computer.)</h3>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Lesson 2 of 4:</p>
      The most important issue to determine when you plan to make a map is its purpose. Why you make the map and whom it is for will guide the rest of the process, from how you make the map to the level of detail.<br />
      Try this activity to examine the choices you will make to produce a finished map.<br />
      (Image is a map of the United States, and colored tan. There is a large brown question mark in the center of the map. Canada is visible above and Mexico below, both shaded gray.)<br />
      <br />
     <h3> <br />
     Step 1 of 9:</h3>
      For this map, you have the option of creating either a map of the U.S. earthquakes or tornadoes for the public. The information will be from the years 1900 to 2009. You must note the sources of your data as well.<br />
      <br />
      What is the purpose for your map, and who is your audience?<br />
      <br />
      Feedback upon selection of U.S. earthquake and epicenters and magnitude:<br />
      (Image shows a map of the United States and is labeled &quot;Top 50 U.S. Earthquakes, 1900-2009.&quot; There is a compass rose with an &quot;N&quot; pointing to the top edge of the map showing north and scale showing 1 inch equals 200 miles. There are gray dots to show locations of the earthquakes throughout the southwest portion of the country, near and in California. Then as we move to the east there is a drastic decrease in the number of earthquake locations. There is a note on the map advising the cartographer's source was fictional data.)<br />
      <br />
      Feedback upon selection of U.S. tornado touchdown points and wind speed:<br />
      (Image shows a map of the United States and is labeled &quot;Top 50 U.S. Tornadoes, 1900-2009.&quot; There is a compass rose with an &quot;N&quot; pointing to the top edge of the map showing north and scale showing 1 inch equals 200 miles. There are gray dots to show locations of the tornadoes throughout the middle east of the country. Then as we move to the east and west there are literally no other tornado locations. There is a note on the map advising the cartographer's source was fictional data.)</h2>

      </h3>
    <h3><br />
    Step 2 of 9:</h3>
    This map is a thematic map of data. However, you may choose to include physical or political features on your map. You could also change the map's projection if that would enhance your map. Albers is best for showing nations at the mid- latitudes, like the United States, so here we will keep that the same. Consider what your audience may need.<br />
    <br />
    What type of map will you need to fit this purpose and audience?<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection of Political map with data:<br />
    (Image is a the map you selected from Step 1 with added state borders and names. We are also able to see cities named on the map; Olympia, WA., Sacramento, CA., Boise, ID., Cheyenne, WY., Denver, CO., Bismarck, ND.,  Austin TX., Springfield, IL., Columbus, OH., Atlanta, GA., Tallahassee, FL., Albany, NY., and Boston, MA. The cartographer's data is again, fictional.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection of Physical map with data:<br />
    (Image is a the map you selected from Step 1 and is colored green, there are brown areas inland from the east and west coasts.)<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <h3>Step 3 of 9:<br /></h3>
    When you make a map, you choose the size of the area you will show. You might choose to focus on the area with the most data, depending on your map's purpose and audience.<br />
    <br />
    How large of an area will you need?<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selecting Map of the 48 contiguous United States:<br />
    (Image the map you  selected in Step 2)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selecting Focus on the western United States:<br />
    (Image of a larger scale map you selected from Step 2, showing the western half of the country. A new map scale shows 1 inch equals 300 miles.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selecting Focus on the eastern United States:<br />
    (Image of a larger scale map you selected from Step 2, showing the eastern half of the country. A new map scale shows 1 inch equals 300 miles.)<br />
    <br />
    <h3><br />
    Step 4 of 9:</h3>
   Your map can show the location of an event, other features of that location, and more specific data about the event. Remember that quantitative data is information you can measure in numbers while qualitative data describes a location. Right now your map shows the location of either earthquakes or tornadoes in 2009. You can include different data through symbols to avoid cluttering your map with text.<br />
   <br />
    What data will you include in your map?<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selecting add more qualitative data:<br />
    (Image of the map you selected in Step 3 with an added map key. The key shows a grey dot for the natural disaster you have selected and advises that dot size is an indication of magnitude. There are now larger dots on the map along with other smaller dots. They are in the same locations.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selecting keep only the data related to location:<br />
    (Image of the map you selected in Step 3 with an added map key. The key shows a grey dot for the natural disaster you have selected. They are in the same locations.)<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <h3>Step 5 of 9:</h3>
   
    Too much data can make a map difficult to read. You can simplify your map by grouping data points close to each other or by reducing your data set. Keep your purpose in mind when making choices to simplify the map.<br />
    <br />
<br />
    How much will you simplify your data?<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selecting reduce your data set to the top 20:<br />
    (Image showing the map you selected in Step 4 with a reduced number of locations on the map. This makes the locations left over more noticeable.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selecting grouping your data set to show only the largest magnitude in each area:<br />
    (Image showing the same map you selected in Step 4 with a number f reduced locations on the map. This makes the locations left over more noticeable but we do not see the magnitude of individual locations.)<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <h3>Step 6 of 9:</h3>
    Color can help clarify map symbols or improve the overall readability of your map. You can use color to group sets of data and simplify your map more.<br />
    <br />
    How will you use color to enhance your map's usability?<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selecting use the color to add interest to the map only:<br />
    (Image of the map you selected in step 5 with a color change to the disaster locations, they are now a bright red and are very noticeable.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selecting use color to group the map data:<br />
    (Image of the map you selected in step 5 showing color changes to the disaster locations. There is a map key to show a different color for each magnitude of your disaster. Yellow is rated as 1, dark yellow is 2, orange is 3, and red is 4-5. This makes the locations very noticeable.)<br />
    <br />

<h2>Impact of your map</h2>
<p>Lesson 3 of 4:</p>
<p>When you make a map, all the choices lead to a map that focuses in on a specific purpose but leaves out details. These choices result in map bias.
<br />
<br />
Consider the sets of data here as they relate to the map you created. How did your choices affect how you displayed this data on the map? <br />
  <br />
  (Image containing two elements; On the left there is a map of the western United States and is labeled "Top 50 U.S. Earthquakes, 1900-2009", the one on the right is a map of the eastern United States and is labeled "Top 20 U.S. Tornadoes, 1900-2009". These are examples of the maps you have just created.)</p>
