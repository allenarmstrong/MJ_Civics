<h2>Communication</h2>

<h3>How can I communicate with my teacher?</h3>

<p>You can communicate by submitting your work and reading your instructor's feedback, by calling when you need immediate help, emailing when you have a question, and using any resources available to you for extra help (e.g. teacher chats or a tutoring center).</p>

  <p>It is extremely important that you turn in the required number of weekly assignments as outlined in your pace chart.</p>
  
  <p>Your instructor is there to help and encourage you to successfully complete this course.</p>
  
  <h3>How often will my work be graded?</h3>
  
  <p>Graded work will be returned to you in a timely manner, typically within 48 hours. It is important that you submit your work to your instructor through the learning management tool. If you send your assignments another way (e.g. email or fax), the grading is more cumbersome, and may require a longer return time.</p>
  
  <h3>How will I get answers to my questions?</h3>
  
  <p>Your instructor will answer your emails within 24 hours. If you need a quick reply, it will help to put <strong>urgent</strong> in the subject area so that your instructor will know you are being held up until he or she replies. Please do not mark emails urgent unless they really are.</p>
  
  <p>The <strong>phone</strong> will get you the quickest response. Please post your instructor's contact information in your work area so you can call  immediately with your questions. Please do not hesitate to call.</p>
