<h1>How Does the Supreme Court Affect Rights?</h1>
<p>The Supreme Court has the power to interpret the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights does not specify when it may be OK to limit individual rights. Laws are sometimes created that restrict individuals' rights for the sake of the <span class="tooltip">common good<span><strong>Common Good:</strong> the greatest possible conditions of society for the greatest number of people living in it</span></span>. Therefore, when people bring their case to the courts, judges can decide whether the Constitution allows a law that restricts the rights of individuals.</p>
<p>The Tinkers' case is just one example of how the Supreme Court can affect rights. In their case, the Supreme Court ruled that students have the right to free speech while at school, including <span class="tooltip">symbolic speech<span><strong>Symbolic Speech:</strong> nonspoken gestures and actions meant to communicate a message that others can understand without explanation</span></span>. However, the justices also ruled that schools do have the right to limit student behavior to protect the learning environment. In the Tinkers' case, the justices did not think the armbands should be banned. They said the school district did not prove the armbands caused great disruption to learning, nor did they invade other students' rights. The justices would support limiting student behaviors that cause significant problem.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court set a <span class="tooltip">precedent<span><strong>Precedent:</strong> a court action or decision used as an example in later cases </span></span> by ruling on this case. This means that judges around the country and in the Supreme Court consider the Tinker ruling when reviewing newer cases about free speech in school. They will have to decide whether the school rule is necessary for learning.</p>

<p>A school is an example of a place where laws may restrict individual rights to protect the common good. For example, students have the right to assemble under the First Amendment. However, school officials may set rules around when, why, and how assemblies may occur. Restrictions help protect safety for everyone at the school.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has ruled on various laws affecting rights not only in schools but in other public areas as well.</p>
