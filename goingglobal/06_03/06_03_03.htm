<h1>What Are North America's Natural Resources?</h1>
<p>Resources are what we use to produce goods and services. The four major types of resources that a country uses are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Land–the natural products of earth like water, wood, and minerals</li>
  <li><span class="tooltip">Labor<span><strong>Labor:</strong> supply of work or workers</span></span>–people who have the skills to create goods and offer services</li>
  <li><span class="tooltip">Capital<span><strong>Capital:</strong> cash for investment, or the tools and knowledge needed to produce something</span></span>–tools, equipment, money, and information</li>
  <li><span class="tooltip">Entrepreneur<span><strong>Entrepreneur:</strong> person who takes a risk to start a new business and try new ideas</span></span>–the leadership and ideas needed to start and grow business</li>
</ul>
<p>Land resources are also called <span class="tooltip">natural resources<span><strong>Natural Resource:</strong> material found in nature that people could use for their own benefit</span></span>. It includes not just <span class="tooltip">arable land<span><strong>Arable Land:</strong> land that can be used to grow crops</span></span>, but other resources that come from Earth. Different countries have varied natural resources. Some natural resources are <span class="tooltip">renewable<span><strong>Renewable:</strong> not likely to run out because of new growth or great supply</span></span> while others are <span class="tooltip">non-renewable<span><strong>Non-renewable:</strong> likely to run out because the supply cannot keep up with use</span></span>.</p>
<p>North America is the continent that includes Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It also includes Central America and the Caribbean countries. Examine these maps to see what resources North America contains and how it compares to other parts of the world.</p>

            Fresh water is an important resource to a country. People need fresh water to survive. They cannot drink ocean water because it contains salt. Growing crops and raising farm animals requires fresh water.  Fresh water is a renewable but limited resource. That means that humans could use it faster than it can renew itself if people are not careful. As you can see on this map, available fresh water varies around the world. "Per capita" means by each person, so to make this map, the amount of fresh water resources for a country was divided by its population.</p>

           Trees are an important natural resource. This map shows the portion of each county's land that has trees growing closely together. Trees provide clean air to breathe, nutrients for soil, and help protect water resources. Trees are very important to human building activities as well. Deforestation refers to land areas where humans and natural events consume trees but do not replace them. Greenland has no significant amount of forest area.</p>
