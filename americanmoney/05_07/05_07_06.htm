<h1>Who Gives Credit to the Government?</h1>
<div class="right img"><img src="images/05_07_06_a.jpg" alt="Saving bonds" /><br /><span class="imgNote">&copy; 2011 AP Images</span></div> 
<p>The U.S. government does not apply for a credit card or bank loan. Rather, the government sells "securities" from the <span class="tooltip">U.S. Treasury<span><strong>U.S. Treasury:</strong> department of the U.S. government responsible for printing currency, issuing securities, collecting taxes, and helping manage the federal debt</span></span>. Have you ever seen a U.S. Savings Bond? This is one type of security. It is an official document a person, business, or government agencies at the local, state, or national level can buy and cash in later. When a person buys a savings bond or other security, they are making a loan to the government. The government pays it back with interest over time. Therefore, the public and government agencies are the ones who give credit to the government.</p>
<p>Banks make bonds and other securities available to the public for purchase. The <span class="tooltip">Federal Reserve<span><strong>Federal Reserve:</strong> central bank of the United States, also known as the Fed</span></span>, or Fed, buys and sells securities to control how many are available to the public at any one time. The Fed controls the <span class="tooltip">market<span><strong>Market:</strong> the exchange of goods and services between buyers and sellers in a place, like a store, or of a particular product, like the market for pizza</span></span> for securities to help encourage or slow growth in the economy, just as it does with setting interest rates for bank loans. For example, when the Fed sells securities it slows down growth because people are using money to buy the securities instead of buying goods and services.</p>
<p>Though the U.S. Treasury issues the different types of securities, Congress must approve increasing a <span class="tooltip">deficit<span><strong>Deficit:</strong> an amount of expenses that exceed income</span></span> to the federal budget. Remember that securities represent a government debt, and running a deficit adds to overall debt. Before taking a vote, Congress must compare the potential risks of increasing the deficit with the potential benefits to the national economy. Many candidates for office at all levels make promises about what they will do to help improve the government's budget.</p>
