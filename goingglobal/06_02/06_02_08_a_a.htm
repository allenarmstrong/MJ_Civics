<h2>Geography Influence: Answers Text Version</h2>
<h3>Slide 1–North American Trade</h3>
<p>(Image: North American with arrows designating trade between Canada and the United States, the United States and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico.)</p>
<p>The United States, Canada, and Mexico are some of each other's greatest trading partners. In fact, Canada and Mexico both export about 75% of their goods and services to the United States alone! They import more than 50% of their products from the United States as well. Most U.S. imports come from China, but that is closely followed by its neighbors!</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Why would Canada, Mexico, and the United States trade so much?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Their closeness makes transportation costs less.</li>
<li>Each has products and services the others want.</li>
<li>The government leaders have friendly ties.</li>
<li><strong>All of the above!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> The answer is all of the above! The cost of trade is less for nearby areas. Countries trade because they have resources and products that others need and want. A good relationship between governments leads to better trade relationships, and the opposite. Two countries that rely heavily on each other for trade are not likely to go to war.</p>
<h3>Slide 2–Early European Settlement</h3>
<p>(Image: North America displaying land claimed during 1750. England claimed the eastern states of the U.S. and central Canada. France claimed the middle of the U.S. and eastern Canada. Spain claimed the western portion of North America. The north west portion of the U.S. was unclaimed during this time period.)</p>
<p>Europeans who explored and settled North America focused on particular areas. Competition between their governments to claim territory was high. To this day, their influence is seen and felt. The United States and Canada have governments heavily based on English traditional laws. The main language spoken in each is English, except for the Canadian province Quebec, where French is the main language. The U.S. state of Louisiana calls its local governments "parishes" from its French background. Most people in Mexico speak Spanish, as do many people in the U.S. Southwest, once part of Mexico. Many Mexican traditions and government policies trace back to Spain. Leaders from these countries who interact often must be very familiar with the others' languages, laws, and cultures.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Since U.S. government and laws mostly came from England, why do so many people speak Spanish in the United States?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Americans who did not like the new government began speaking Spanish in protest.</li>
<li><strong>People of the United States and Mexico spread the language through trade, migration, and territory changes.</strong></li>
<li>The people who came from England all knew Spanish and taught it to their children.</li>
<li>The majority of Europeans who came to the United States were actually from Spain.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> The answer is B! Most Spanish settlers migrated to South America, the Caribbean, and Mexico. A large portion of Mexico became U.S. territory after a war. All the people living there became part of the United States. Through movement and trade of families and friends, the language has spread further.</p>
<h3>Slide 3–Water Resources</h3>
<p>(Image: North America with the Mississippi River, Great Lakes, St. Lawrence River, Gulf of Mexico, Rio Grande, Atlantic Ocean, and Pacific Ocean labled.)</p>
<p>The Mississippi River attracted many settlers. People even today tend to settle close to areas with water. Near the river is fertile soil for growing crops. Rivers like the Mississippi and St. Lawrence make it easier to move goods for trade. The Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Atlantic Ocean form pathways to Europe and Africa. The mouth of the Mississippi River is still a busy area for shipping and trade. Control of that area was in dispute for many years before the U.S. government established it as territory. Closeness to water also provides other ways to earn a living, such as fishing and oil drilling. Water can create electric power. Water access and the minerals and life within are important resources.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Most of the Canadian and U.S. population is concentrated in the East. However, the western boundary of the United States is also heavily populated. Why?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Another river connects this area to the Mississippi River.</li>
<li>The center of the United States lacks land suited for farming.</li>
<li>People cannot spread further west, so they are stuck in crowded areas.</li>
<li><strong>It is a coastline, which improves access to greater resources and products.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> The western boundary is coastline of the Pacific Ocean! Industries related to ocean life and trade are important here. People and businesses are drawn to areas with water access because it provides transportation. Ocean water has seafood and other important resources. Also, note that dry areas of North America, like in portions of the U.S. Southwest, do not have populations as high as areas with plenty of rainfall and water access. We need fresh water to live!</p>
<h3>Slide 4–Land Features</h3>
<p>(Image: North America with the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, Appalachians, Sierra Madre Oriental, and Sierra Madre Occidental labled.)</p>
<p>Mountains create challenges for people, businesses, and governments alike! As population spread to the west, the people wanted a way to travel easier between other areas. Different areas of the country wanted to be able to trade with one another. The United States built a great railroad that crossed the Rocky Mountains. It was expensive and dangerous. People who migrated from other countries were offered this dangerous work for low pay. Many accepted because they wanted to live in the growing United States. Canals and highways also improved transportation of goods and people. Mountainous areas have opportunities as well as challenges. Coal, an important fuel source, is mined in the Appalachian Mountains.  Mining for coal and other important resources like diamonds and silver happens in Canada and Mexico, too. Countries' governments establish safety standards for dangerous activities like mining and construction. They also make agreements and laws about accepting workers from other countries on a temporary or permanent basis.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Which is the best reason for a national government to care about how a foreign government treats and protects workers?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><strong>The country will not likely want to trade for products from businesses that mistreat workers. Buying those products would keep the business in operation, leading to mistreatment of more workers.</strong></li>
<li>The country would want to make sure it has better or worse conditions, depending on whether it wants people to emigrate from the other country or not.</li>
<li>The country only cares if some of its people work in the other country. Otherwise, it is considered a private matter to the other country.</li>
<li>The country believes that unhappy workers produce lower-quality goods. It only wants to buy products higher in quality than its own.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Many governments often debate ethics in trade practices. The best answer is A. The other answers are not likely to be proven facts for any situation. If a country's businesses treat their workers badly and the government does nothing, it can be bad for trade. The people may demand their own government do something to help people elsewhere; they might even stop buying the products. Trade is limited even today between North American countries and other places because of foreign governments' actions or lack of action.</p>
<h3>Slide 5–Location and Migration</h3>
<p>(Image: Compass Rose)</p>
<p>A country's absolute and relative location affect climate and industries. The United States crosses many areas of latitude, leading to diverse climates and crop production. Improvements in farming make it possible for most people in North America to do other types of work. Opportunities in Canada and the United States attract immigrants, many from Mexico, which is still developing its industries. Many Mexicans seek the better pay for work offered in the United States to improve their lives. People who want a vacation or a life without snow are attracted to Florida and Mexico for the warmer climates. Alaska, the northernmost and largest U.S. state, is too cold for many Americans. Its population is concentrated in the south. However, Alaska is home to many recreation opportunities, and it has productive fishing, forestry, and oil industries.</p>
<p>Most Canadians live along Canada's southern border with the United States where it is warmest and work opportunities are most available. Forestry is a big industry in Canada. Wood from that country helps support the heavy construction in the United States.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Which of the following is most likely to convince an experienced construction worker to move from Florida to Canada?</p>
<ol>
<li>warmer weather</li>
<li>higher latitude</li>
<li>crop production</li>
<li><strong>forestry work</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Work in forestry is most likely to attract an experienced construction worker from Florida. He or she might move to Canada to try a related line of work. Canada does not have the warmer weather or more crop production opportunities. Latitude by itself would not attract people but rather the differences it creates, such as climate.</p>
<h3>Slide 6–International Borders</h3>
<p>(Image: North America with international borders and Cuba labeled.)</p>
<p>The borders between countries are important places. Often, they are based on geographic features, such as the Rio Grande River between Texas and Mexico. Countries also lay claim over water, to an extent. Countries may disagree over the claims, especially when a valuable resource like oil is involved.  For example, the United States has disputes with Canada and Mexico over where their control ends over water. The disputes  relate most to control of fishing or oil activities.  The U.S.-Canada border is in dispute, with the line dividing people's property in some places!</p>
<p>Resources lead to businesses, jobs, and income for the people of a country. The industries based on these resources can attract people to other countries. Increases or decreases in population affect government services, crime, and other aspects of life. People might be desperate to leave a country because of problems there, and other countries feel a responsibility to protect them. For example, some people from Mexico, Cuba, and other areas wish to move to the United States. They hope for opportunities not available at home. Americans disagree whether more people from other countries should be allowed to move to the United States. Luckily, the governments of most of these countries have friendly relationships. Trade between them is very important to protect. They consult each other often to work out these issues.</p>
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Why would one government wish to prevent war with its neighbor?</p>
<ol>
<li>It would not worry about preventing war unless it thought it could not win.</li>
<li>It would not want a war because the countries could never be friends again.</li>
<li>War can help improve an economy by creating jobs to build military supplies.</li>
<li><strong>War would stop trade between the countries, hurting people and businesses.</strong></li>
</ol>  
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> War disrupts trade between countries at war and even their trade with uninvolved countries. That can lead to job losses and businesses closing for the people at home. Neighboring countries depend a lot on each other, and war can lead to long-term problems for both.</p>
