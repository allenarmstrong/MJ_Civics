<h1>What Happens During a Criminal or Civil Trial?</h1>
<p>A criminal or civil trial has many steps and so is both time-consuming and expensive. Lawyers often attempt to avoid trial. An example of a way to avoid a criminal trial is if the suspect in a crime is willing to enter a guilty <span class="tooltip">plea<span><strong>Plea:</strong> to declare guilt or innocence</span></span> for a lesser crime. An example in a civil case would be if the lawyers could assist both sides in reaching an agreement before going to court. We call this process <span class="tooltip">mediation<span><strong>Mediation:</strong> a process where an outside person works with people on both sides of a dispute to try to help them reach an agreement without going to court</span></span>. A person who is not connected to the case or those involved can assist the mediation. The mediator will help each side identify the issues, encourage working together to solve problems, and help explore ways to settle their dispute. The people on each side of the case make the final decisions, which may be that they still wish to go to trial.</p> 
<p>Avoiding trial not only saves time and money, it relieves the court from having to go to trial for every case. It helps ensure justice by allowing a court to give full attention to cases that must go to trial. Note that when people make an agreement to avoid trial, they give up their right to a jury trial.</p>
<p>If a trial must occur, it will follow five main steps. If a person is found guilty of a crime, the judge will usually determine the sentence later in a separate court procedure.  In most civil cases, the jury will determine if compensation is owed and, if so, the amount. Examine the steps for more information about this process.</p>

            <h2>Jury Selection</h2>
            <div class="left img"><img src="images/03_07_04_02_jury.jpg" alt="Jury Selection"/></div>
            <p>Citizens who receive notice to appear attend court on their assigned day. Lawyers on each side of the case may question the potential jurors in a process called voir dire, meaning, "to speak the truth." The lawyers and judge may dismiss jurors who they think will not fairly consider the facts of the case before making a decision. A jury usually has 12 members. Once the jurors are selected, the trial may begin.</p>

            <h2>The Trial</h2>
            <div class="right img"><img src="images/03_07_04_03_trial.jpg" alt="Jury Selection"/></div>
            <p>The trial is where lawyers on each side present their case. They use evidence and witness testimony to try to persuade the jurors to agree with their side. They will give an opening statement to introduce the points they will try to prove. After lawyers present all the evidence, each lawyer may make a closing statement as well, making their final arguments to try to convince the jury.</p>

            <div class="left img"><img src="images/03_07_04_04_judge.jpg" alt="Jury Selection"/></div>
            <p>The Judge's Charge is where the judge gives instructions to the jury for deliberation. The judge explains the rules the jury must follow. In addition, the judge will explain the specific laws that relate to the case and what they mean.</p>

            <div class="right img"><img src="images/03_07_04_05_deliberations.jpg" alt="Jury Selection"/></div>
            <p>Jury members go to a room away from the courtroom. First, they determine who will be the foreman, or leader of the jury. He or she leads the discussion, keeps the members on task, and ensures all jurors participate fairly. They will discuss all the facts and evidence of the case fairly and with an open mind. </p>

            <div class="left img"><img src="images/03_07_04_06_verdict.jpg" alt="Jury Selection"/></div>
            <p>The verdict is the jury's final decision of whether the suspect of a crime is guilty or not or who is at fault if anyone in a civil case. All jurors must agree to the final verdict. The foreman will present the verdict to the judge and court. </p>
