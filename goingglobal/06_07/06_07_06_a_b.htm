<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>One role of the U.S. president is to respond to international issues. He or she depends on the advisors in the Cabinet. They must provide accurate information and guidance. The president often consults Cabinet members before making important decisions.</p>
<h4>Conflict</h4>
<p>Cuban military invaded Eastern Mexico in a surprise attack. Cuba intends to gain territory and control of passage into the Gulf of Mexico. You need to make a recommendation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Imagine you and your team are advisors in the Cabinet. The president is concerned and not sure how to respond to the conflict. The memos from the different advisors on the conflict do not match. The president wants you and the other advisors to consider the situation and make a team recommendation. Your team will share the ideas you presented for the lesson assignment. You will discuss them, add new ideas, and create a team recommendation. Use the Collaboration Assessment Guide (insert link to Collaboration Assessment Guide) to form your team and start this activity.</p>

<h3>Step One: Discuss the Conflict</h3>

<p>Discuss how the conflict might affect the United States. Consider where the conflict is happening. List the international organizations to which each country belongs. Why might each organization be concerned about the conflict? How does it involve the United States? Share information from your memo assignment, and discuss as a team. Use the <strong>Cabinet Brainstorm Chart</strong> to keep track of the team discussion.</p> 
 
 <h3>Step Two: Conduct Background Research</h3>
 
 <p>What lessons have been learned in history about responding to international conflicts? Discuss the examples each advisor wrote for his or her memo. How does each relate to the current crisis? Are there other examples in history that relate? Why are they important?</p>

<h3>Step Three: Determine All the Possible Options</h3>

<p>How should the United States respond to the crisis? Brainstorm all the possible responses. Use the foreign policy spectrum to make a list. Discuss the recommendation each team member wrote for the memo. What could be the outcome for each recommendation? Would the outcomes hurt or help the conflict? Would the outcomes hurt or help relations between the United States and the rest of the world?</p> 
<p>As a team, you should agree on how the United States should respond. Do not simply pick one team member's idea, but rather reach an agreement between all members on the best action. Be sure to note the reasons that convinced all the members to support that response.</p>

<h3>Step Four: Make a choice</h3>

<p>Create a presentation that explains your team recommendation to the president. Be sure to include this information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>how the conflict could affect the United States</li>
  <li>what international organizations could become involved and why</li>
  <li>lessons from other international conflicts in history</li>
  <li>how the United States should respond</li>
  <li>reasons why the team agreed on that response</li>
</ul>
<p>Your team can choose your format. Imagine your team will present it to the president in an official meeting. Example formats include slideshow or video. Be creative and include pictures that will help the president understand your points.</p>
