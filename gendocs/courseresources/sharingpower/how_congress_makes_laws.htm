                	<p>All bills start as an idea. Bills may begin in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. The representative or senator introduces his or her bill. The idea is read, given a number, and referred to a committee or subcommittee. The "H" or "S" in front of a bill number tells you whether it began in the House or the Senate. About 9,000 bills are introduced each year in Congress, but only about 10% become law.</p>

                	<p>Most of the work on bills (tweaking language, editing) happens in committees. The legislators might edit the language, make additions, or take things out. Together, the House and Senate have 40 committees and 160 subcommittees. Representatives and senators will serve on committees or subcommittees that match their backgrounds or areas of interest.</p>

                	<img src="../../../sharingpower/03_04/images/03_04_05_03.jpg" alt="Image 3" />
               
                	<p>Work in the full committee is the hardest step for a bill to pass. Only one in six bills will pass this step. The full committee may make more edits to the bill language before taking a vote. If the bill does pass, it will go to the whole House or Senate for debate. For the House, however, first they set up rules about the debate in the House Rules Committee.</p>

                	<p>The House Rules Committee will set rules for debate on the bill. Examples of these rules can include the time allowed for debate. It might limit the number of changes that can be made to the bill. The Senate has fewer rules and unlimited time for debate.</p>

                	<p>Debate of the whole House or Senate is called "Floor Action." This step is challenging because representatives and senators come from different parts of the nation. Each member has different interests and concerns. The bill needs approval from a majority of people in both chambers to advance.</p>

                	<p>A compromise committee with members from both the House and the Senate meet. They discuss differences between each chamber's versions of the bill. They will compromise on the differences to create a single bill. A compromise happens when by both sides give up some things they originally wanted.</p>

                	<p>The compromise bill is sent back to both the House and the Senate. Members in each debate the compromise version of the bill. They vote on whether to approve it. Approval from both House and Senate is required on the same exact version of the bill for it to continue.</p>

                	<p>Congress sends the approved bill to the president. The president signs the majority of passed bills into law. However, the president may choose to veto the bill. Congress may override the president's veto with a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate. If the override succeeds, the bill becomes law. Congress considers the president's views throughout the process to prevent a veto.</p>
