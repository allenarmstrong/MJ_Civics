<h1>How Does the Media Impact Government?</h1>
<p><span class="tooltip">Media<span><strong>Media:</strong> the various means of sharing information, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the Internet</span></span> means the various means of sharing information. Examples include television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the Internet. Some Americans say the media are the "<span class="tooltip">watchdogs<span><strong>Watchdog:</strong> a person or group guarding against illegal, wasteful, or unacceptable practices</span></span>" of government. They mean that the media help inform the people what their officials are doing.</p>

<p>For example, many websites report how members of Congress vote on new policies. We can see government leaders debate important issues on television. Radio show hosts share their opinions on new laws and programs. Writers of books and newspapers <span class="tooltip">analyze<span><strong>Analyze:</strong> to examine something in detail in order to understand it better, often by breaking it down into parts</span></span> the meaning behind the speeches of leaders. Interest groups use the media to spread their messages to elected officials and the <span class="tooltip">public<span><strong>Public:</strong> relating to the community as a whole, concerning all of its members</span></span>. Government leaders pay attention to the media. Monitoring the media is one way government leaders can learn how people feel about important issues and the peoples' opinion on how well government is addressing them.</p>

<p><br><br>Elected officials also use the media to communicate with the people. The president meets with reporters to explain policies. People running for office place ads in all forms of media to spread their message. Since each ad supports a certain interest, we say it has <span class="tooltip">bias<span><strong>Bias:</strong> preference toward a particular belief or attitude</span></span>. Citizens hear and see many biased messages each day. As an active citizen, you should follow different media sources for the facts in order to draw your own conclusions.</p><br>
