<h2>Sources of Law Text Version</h2>
<p>What are sources of law? You've probably heard that the Constitution of the United States is the foundation of the laws in our country. But what are the sources of the law? One source is our statutes. Statutes are the laws that are passed by each state's legislature or the U.S. Congress. Here's an example of a book of statutes from my home state. And these laws in these statute books cover everything from marriage, to divorce, to buying property, to handling probate, wills, to dealing with crimes, juvenile matters, educational issues. They cover the whole gamut of what of what governments regulate and what the laws require us to do and not do. Another source of law is case law. You may have heard of the word jurisprudence used before. That basically is decisions made by courts and how they interpret statutes, the laws of the land, over a course of time.</p>
