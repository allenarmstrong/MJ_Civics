 <h1>Map Tutorial&mdash;Map Analysis Check Answers</h1>
 <p><strong>Lesson 2 of 5:</strong></p>
 <p>Question 1 of 8</p>
  <p>What type of map is this and what does the title reveal about the map?  </p>
  <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <em>This is a political map. The title reveals that the map’s purpose is to show the different regions in the United States.</em></p>
  <p>Question 2 of 8</p>
  <p>What map features are the most important to understanding the map?</p>
  <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong><em> The colors and land separation indicate the regions. The state borders show what states are in each region.  Each region has a name.

</em></p>
  <p>Question 3 of 8</p>
  <p>List specific things you see on this map that you think are important?</p>
  <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <em>Some regions are larger than others. Each region does not include an equal number of states. The West includes Alaska and Hawaii.</em> </p>
  <p>Question 4 of 8</p>
  <p>What patterns do you see or connections can you make in the map?  </p>
  <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong><em> The West contains areas with very different climates.  New England is the smallest region, maybe because it has such a large population.</em></p>
  <p>Question 5 of 8</p>
  <p>What type of map is this and what does the title reveal about the map?</p>
  <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong><em> This is a thematic map showing U.S. net migration.  “Net Migration” means just the difference between numbers of people moving in and those moving out, instead of showing both.</em> </p>
  <p>Question 6 of 8</p>
  <p>What map features are the most important to understanding the map?</p>
  <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong><em> The arrows show the main point of the map, which is where people moved from and their destination. The thickness of the arrows shows how large the number of people moving was compared to other directions.</em></p>
  <p>Question 7 of 8</p>
<p>List specific things you see on this map that you think are important.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong><em> The largest arrows are pointing to the South. There are no arrows pointing to the Northeast.</em> </p>
<p>Question 8 of 8</p>
  <p>What patterns do you see or connections can you make in the map?  </p>
  <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong><em> The South grew the most, with more people moving in from all the other regions than moved out. The Northeast was just the opposite, with more people heading out to other regions than heading in.</em></p>
