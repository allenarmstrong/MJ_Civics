<h2>How can we make sense of maps?</h2>
<p>Lesson 1 of 9:</p>
<p> View this slide show to see some common map features.</p>
<p>Screen 1 of 5:</p>
<p><em>Image of overhead map with two-dimensional shapes to represent land layouts and buildings; streets are thick gray lines with the names clearly labeled on them; grassy areas are colored green. There is a lake, colored blue, between Parque de Camino and Calle de Waters.</em></p>
<p>Maps come in many orientations and languages to suit a variety of purposes. However, no matter what type of map you study, there are some features you will likely find on most maps.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 2 of 5:</p>
<p><em>Image uses same elements as in Screen 1 but with more advanced map items added: there is a title at the top of the map with the label &quot;El Mapa de la Ciudad;&quot; there is a compass rose in the top-right corner with an arrow point up towards the letter &quot;N;&quot; there is an inch-wide scale at the bottom-right corner that indicates how big one mile is on the map; in the bottom-left corner, there is a map key with a red circle next to the label &quot;Biblioteca,&quot; a green circle next to the label &quot;Parque,&quot; and a yellow dot next to the label &quot;Restaurante;&quot; the yellow dot is placed on a building in the top-left corner of the map, the green dot is placed under the lake in the middle-bottom section of the map, and the red dot is placed on a building in the middle-right side of the map.</em></p>
<p>This map includes a title, a scale, a legend or map key, a compass rose, and symbols, and it uses color.</p>


<p>Screen 3 of 5:</p>
<p><em>Image uses same elements as in Screen 2 but with English labels instead of Spanish to tailor the map for a different language-speaking individual. There is a title at the top of the map with the label &quot;Map of the City;&quot; in the bottom-left corner, there is a legend box with a red circle next to the label &quot;Library,&quot; a green circle next to the label &quot;Park,&quot; and a yellow dot next to the label &quot;Restaurant.</em><em>&quot;</em></p>
<p>These features enable you to get information even from unfamiliar maps. How a cartographer chooses specific features and uses them in a map depends on the needs of the people who will use the map.</p>

<p>Screen 4 of 5:</p>
<p><em>Image uses the map of a city with the title &quot;Jacksonville Area Road Map&quot; in the upper left. There is  a compass rose labeled &quot;N&quot; with arrow pointing to the upper edge of the map, and there is a map  scale</em><em> that indicates  one inch on the map represents two miles of distance at the upper right. Below the map's title there is a key that shows two red parallel lines indicating an interstate highway; a solid gray line to indicate a country road; and a broken gray line to indicate railroads. The map detail shows Jacksonville with a large body of water dividing the east and west areas. A number of interstate highways connects the eastern land mass to the western land mass and seems to encircle the city. There are a number of country roads and railroad paths that connect other smaller streets and sub-urban areas of the city to each other and the interstates. The interstate and country roads are labeled with their highway numbers.</em></p>
<p>This map uses color to indicate major routes and symbols to show whether the route is an interstate highway, an intrastate highway, or a county road.</p>
<p>Screen 5 of 5:</p>
<p><em>Image is a map of Australia shaded with greens and yellows. Along the upper edge is a title &quot;Physical Map of Australia&quot;, a map scale indicating one inch represents five hundred miles</em><em>, and a compass rose labeled with &quot;N&quot; pointing to the top edge of the map. The map  shows that large bodies of water surround Australia, with the Indian Ocean named in the west, and Pacific Ocean in the east. Australia is further divided into &quot;regions&quot; shown on the key as a solid red line. </em><em>The regions are Western Australia,  Northern Territory  South Australia, Queensland  New South Wales. There are also cities shown on the map key with a black ring. Cities are named clockwise starting with Perth (Western Australia), Darwin (Northern Territory), Brisbane (Queensland), and Sydney (New south Wales.)</em></p>
<p>This map uses color to indicate land and water. Text indicates the names of landforms, bodies of water, and the regions of Australia.</p>

<h2>Map Title</h2>
<p>Lesson 2 of 9:</p>
<p> The title of a map is an important clue to it's main idea and purpose. For example, the title &quot;Historic Track of Hurricane Katrina&quot; tells you several things. The map will include;</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Historic&quot; - Suggests time and a point of origin where the storm developed as well as where it lost hurricane status.</li>
<li>&quot;Track&quot; - Suggests a line showing the path of the hurricane.</li>
<li>&quot;Hurricane Katrina&quot; - Specific storm suggests the area represented on the map.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Image shows a map titled &quot;Historic Track of Hurricane Katrina&quot; at the top edge of the map and a  compass rose in the upper right side with &quot;N&quot; pointing to the top edge. The map shows the southeastern United States, with the Gulf of Mexico is shown to the south and Atlantic Ocean on the east. The storm is marked as a yellow dot to show a tropical depression, then red dot with arms spinning to show a hurricane, then a red dot to show a tropical storm. There are dates listed showing the different stages of the storm as it moves from the Atlantic Ocean, over land, then into the Gulf of Mexico and into the southern states.</em></p>
<p class="textOnly"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
</div>

<div id="les3" class="slide">
<h2>Compass Rose</h2>
<p>Lesson 3 of 9:</p>
<p> The <strong>compass rose</strong> shows you the <strong>cardinal directions</strong> (north, east, west, and south) as they relate to the map layout. Most maps sold in the United States have north pointing to the top edge of the map. If you face north, east is to your right, west is to your left, and south extends behind you.</p>
<p><em>Image shows a compass rose, which has 8 points, 4 are titled showing the cardinal directions. The rose shows &quot;N&quot; at the top, &quot;E&quot; at the right, &quot;S&quot; at the bottom, and &quot;W&quot; at the right.</em></p>
<p class="textOnly"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
</div>
<div id="les4" class="slide">
<h2>Map Scale</h2>
<p>Lesson 4 of 9:</p>
<p>A maps <strong>scale</strong>, which is the size ratio, such as one unit equaling 50 units in the original object, tells you the size of the area shown on the map. It also helps you estimate distances between points on the map. The larger the area of the map, the more miles one unit of space on the map represents. As the map area grows larger, the map scale grows smaller, and individual places get smaller.</p>
<p>Screen 1 of 2:</p>
<p>Large-scale maps like this one cover smaller areas so they can include significant detail. You can remember that objects appear larger on this map than on the small scale version. Notice that there are about twenty miles between points A and B on this map.</p>
<p><em>Image of a map with a scale showing an inch represents one hundred miles. In the center there are two dots labeled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and almost one hundred miles to the upper left, Kansas City is labeled next to an orange star.</em></p>
<p>Screen 2 of 2:</p>
<p>Small-scale maps like this one cover much larger areas, so there is far less detail. Objects appear much smaller here than on the large-scale version. Notice that on this map you can barely distinguish between points A and B.</p>
<p><em>Image  uses the same markings as screen 1 but is a larger map of the United States, a map scale shows an inch represents five hundred miles. The markings are much smaller and less visible, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have almost no separation between them.</em></p>

<p class="textOnly"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
</div>
<div id="les5" class="slide">
<h2>Symbols</h2>
<p>Lesson 5 of 9:</p>
<p>A <strong>legend or map key</strong> explains the use of symbols on the map. Symbols show information on a map by reducing the need for text labels, saving space. Symbols come in three main types:</p>
<ul>
<li>area, like the color blue to mark bodies of water or a dotted pattern to show where oranges grow</li>
<li>line, like railroad tracks or states' borders</li>
<li>point, like the center of a city or the location of a school</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple types of each symbol can be used on the same map.</p>
<p><em>Image shows a map of Florida, parts of Alabama and Georgia can be seen at the top edge. A map key is listed in the lower left showing a yellow star for the state capital, a black dot for a major city, a white line for state borders, and orange dots for orange groves. Major cities are listed from bottom to top as Miami, Tampa and Orlando, and Jacksonville, and Pensacola is to the far left. Tallahassee, the state capital, is listed between Pensacola and Jacksonville. The map is shaded from Miami to Orlando with orange groves.</em></p>

<p class="textOnly"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
</div>
<div id="les6" class="slide">
<h2>More About Symbols</h2>
<p>Lesson 6 of 9:</p>
<p> Cartographers choose symbols carefully, depending on the purpose of the map. For example, if you were making a map to teach younger children the continents and oceans, you might not include country borders and names.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were making a road map for tourists, you would probably include picture symbols for major landmarks, such as historic sites and national parks. This way you not only help the tourists navigate the area but also encourage them to visit these interesting places.</p>
<p><em>Image one is a map of the  world. The map has continents labeled North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia. The oceans are also labeled, South Pacific Ocean, North Atlantic, South Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, North Pacific Ocean. Then a second image appears showing a city with a series of named streets and roadways, we are also able to see the names of landmarks or places of interest.</em></p>

<p class="textOnly"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
</div>
<div id="les7" class="slide">
<h2>Color</h2>
<p>Lesson 7 of 9:</p>
<p> Color is a critical part of most maps. It makes parts of the map stand out and grab the user's attention. Like symbols, cartographers use color in ways that suit a map's purpose. The colors in a map may be symbols themselves.</p>
<p>For example, this map shows climate areas of the United States. Each color represents a different climate type, so color is a symbol on this map.</p>
<p><em>Image shows a map of the United States, it is tilted &quot;U.S. Climate Map.&quot; There is a key in the lower left corner showing red for &quot;hot-dry,&quot; orange for &quot;hot-humid,&quot; green for &quot;mixed-humid,&quot; light blue for &quot;cold,&quot; and dark blue for &quot;very cold.&quot; Light blue takes up almost half of the northern states, with some dark blue in the far north, red in the southwest, orange in the south east and green in the mid-east.</em></p>

<p class="textOnly"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
</div>
<div id="les8" class="slide">
<h2>More About Color</h2>
<p>Lesson 8 of 9:</p>
<p>  In political maps, states and/or countries appear in different colors to draw attention to their size and border locations. Areas that border each other may appear in different colors.</p>
<p>The cartographer might use shaded relief, pictured in this political map, to show the shape of the land, as it would appear with the sun shining on it. This helps the user imagine how the land looks in a certain place. Some versions of blue indicates water on most maps.</p>
<p><em>Image of a map of southwestern United States, the Pacific Ocean is labeled. Oregon state is colored green, Idaho is pink, and Boise is marked with a black star. Utah is Purple, and Salt Lake City is labeled with a black star, Arizona is pink with Phoenix labeled with a black star. California is  orange and Sacramento is labeled with a black star. Nevada is yellow and Carson City is labeled with a black Star. The map is shaded with relief showing changes in elevations.</em></p>
