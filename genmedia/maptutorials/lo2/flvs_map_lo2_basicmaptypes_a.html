<p>Lesson 1 of 8:</p>

<p><em>Image of three different maps side by side. Map 1 shows the state of Missouri and bordering states, and names of larger urban areas are labeled. Map 2 shows Central United States,  different shades of brown and green, waterways are indicated in blue. No places are labeled. Map 3 shows the United States, no areas are labeled. There are different color arrows,  big capital L's for low pressure currents and H's for high pressure currents, some colored arrows indicating direction, and what looks like currents. Same image on Screens 1-3.</em></p>
<p> Your friend has three maps. Each one is the same area but shows different information. Help your friend choose the map she needs for each task.</p>

<p>Question 1 of 3:</p>
<p>Your friend needs some help. Which map will help her determine the current weather in Kansas City, Missouri?</p>

  <ol type="a">
      <li>Map 1</li>
      <li>Map 2</li>
      <li>Map 3</li>
</ol>
  <p>Question 2 of 3:</p>
  
  <p>Now your friend wants to find out what cities are near Kansas City, Missouri. Which map should she use?</p>
<ol type="a">
      <li>Map 1</li>
      <li>Map 2</li>
  <li>Map 3</li><br />
</ol>
<p>Question 3 of 3:</p>
          <p>Your friend wonders if there are mountains in Kansas. Which map should she use?</p>

  <h2>Basic Map Types</h2>
  <p>Lesson 2 of 8:</p>
  <p><em>Images of physical, political, and thematic maps. The images can be clicked on to enlarge each image.</em></p>
<p>Maps come in many different types to meet various needs. We organize them into three main types: physical, political, and thematic. Let's look at each in more detail.</p>

  <h2>Physical Maps</h2>
  <p>Lesson 3 of 8:</p>
  <p><em>Image of a physical map with a chart of Example Features and Example Uses (see below).</em></p>
  <p><strong>Physical maps</strong>, which are maps that focus on the natural features of the earth, show only Earth's natural features. Physical maps change very slowly because changes on Earth happen very gradually over time. In a purely physical map, you would see no cultural features, which are human-made. Often, however, physical maps will show country borders and major cities for the benefit of the map user. Examine these features and uses for physical maps.</p>
<h4>Example Features</h4>
<ul>
      <li>mountains</li>
      <li>hills</li>
      <li>valleys</li>
      <li>oceans</li>
      <li>rivers</li>
      <li>lakes</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Example Uses</h4>
<ul>
      <li>Surveyors use them to provide information about existing roads and structures to architects and land developers.</li>
      <li>Meteorologists use them to help explain weather forecasts to the public.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Political Maps</h2>
  <p>Lesson 4 of 8:</p>
  <p><em>Image of a political map of the Southern United States. There is a road sign sticking out of the map, approximately where Georgia would be, that says &quot;Welcome, we're glad Georgia is on your mind&quot; with an image of a peach on it.</em></p>
<p>We use place names all the time in conversation to reference location. &quot;He grew up near Miami,&quot; is an example. &quot;Her favorite spot was a campsite just past the Georgia state line,&quot; is another. We see borders for these places on most maps. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that people create borders to organize government authority. This is why we say they are cultural, or human-made. From space, you cannot see an actual line separating Georgia from Florida. Land or water features sometimes serve as borders, such as the Rio Grande, which separates Texas from Mexico.</p>

  <h2>Political Maps</h2>
  <p>Lesson 5 of 8:</p>
  <p><em>Image of political map with locations and icons for universities and parks indicated.</em></p>
<p><strong>Political maps</strong>, which are maps that focus on the human-made features of the earth, focus on cultural, or human-made, features. These maps show how humans have interacted with their environment. The borders of states, regions, and countries are prominent. The names and locations of capitals, cities, and towns appear. Detailed political maps of a city may show important public spaces like schools and parks. Cartographers update political maps far more often than physical maps. One reason for border changes is war and ethnic conflict.</p>

  <h2>Changing Political Maps</h2>
  <p>Lesson  6 of 8:</p>
  <p><em>Image of a transforming map titled &quot;The Transformation of Yugoslavia.&quot; The image starts off with a map of the country of Yugoslavia and bordering countries. The image then transforms into a map of the countries that now replace the former Yugoslavia and bordering counties.</em></p>
<p>For example, the former country of Yugoslavia had shifting borders throughout the 20th century. Its people had deep cultural differences, which led to violence. Since 1991, the Yugoslavia area has been breaking up along cultural borders. Today, the area contains many separate nations, including Serbia. The people continue to demand political changes, so map updates are frequent. Cartographers must determine the best way to address disputed areas within their maps. </p>

  <h2>Thematic Maps</h2>
  <p>Lesson 7 of 8:</p>
  <p><em>Images of population density, road, and climate maps. The images can be clicked on to enlarge each image.</em></p>
<p><strong>Thematic maps</strong>, which are maps that focus on a single piece of information or theme, usually focus on a single piece of information or theme. Road maps, maps of natural resources, and weather forecast maps are all examples of thematic maps. The frequency of change depends on the information shown on the map.</p>
<p>A climate map, for example, will not change as often as a daily temperature forecast map because climate patterns tend to be stable over long periods. Road maps change frequently because of construction, maintenance, and detours. Technology enables us to update this information much faster than before.</p>
