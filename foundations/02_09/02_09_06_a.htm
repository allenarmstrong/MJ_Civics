<h2>What Are Some Other Failed Amendment Ideas? Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Child Labor–</strong>Would give Congress the power to limit, control, or possibly prohibit work for those under 18 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>Term Limits for Congress–</strong>Would limit how many times a person could be elected to serve in the House of Representatives or Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced Budget–</strong>Would require equal amounts of income and spending of the federal government each year.</p>
<p><strong>Every Vote Counts–</strong>Would end the Electoral College method of electing the president in favor of a direct national election.</p>
<p><strong>Death Penalty Abolition–</strong>Would prohibit the use of the death penalty as punishment anywhere in U.S. territory.</p>
<p><strong>Flag Desecration–</strong>Would make certain images and actions related to the U.S. flag (such as burning the flag in protest) against the Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Equal Opportunity to Govern–</strong>Would allow naturalized citizens at least 20 years old to run for president.</p>
<p><strong>English as Official Language–</strong>Would establish English as the official language of the United States, requiring public signs and notices to be printed in English and no other language, and English-only instruction in public schools.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Bear Arms–</strong>Would repeal the Second Amendment which does not specify a purpose for firearms, and state that people have the right to firearms for &ldquo;<em>hunting, sport, collecting, and personal defense.&rdquo;</em></p>
