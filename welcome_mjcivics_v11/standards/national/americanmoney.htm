  <td>Lesson 01: How Does Scarcity Affect Us?</td>
  <td>CEE.8.1.A: Scarcity is the condition of not being able to have all of the goods and services that one wants. It exists because human wants for goods and services exceed the quantity of goods and services that can be produced using all available resources.
  <br>
CEE.8.1.C: Choices involve trading off the expected value of one opportunity against the expected value of its best alternative.
<br>
CEE.8.2.A: To determine the best level of consumption of a product, people must compare the additional benefits with the additional costs of consuming a little more or a little less.
<br>
CEE.8.8.A:  An increase in the price of a good or service encourages people to look for substitutes, causing the quantity demanded to decrease, and vice versa. This relationship between price and quantity demanded, known as the law of demand, exists as long as other factors influencing demand do not change.
