<h2>Beach Scene Text Version</h2>
<p>When you think of a beach, you may think of sun, sand, and the smell of sunscreen.</p>
<p>"America's coastlineâ€”beautiful and popular for residents and visitors alike. The coasts are important to people for fun as well as to earn a living. Fishing, shipping, tourism, farming, and scientific research are just a few activities along the coast.</p>
<p>So what happens when disaster strikes? In April 2010, pressure in an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico caused an explosion and the well to leak. Eleven workers died and nearly 206 million gallons of oil flowed into the waters. Businesses, government agencies, and volunteers went to work to contain the oil and stop the leak. In February 2011, you could still see oil in the water and on the shoreline. The impact of the spill still affects people especially along the coastline of Louisiana and Northwest Florida."</p>
