<h2>Option B: Write a Letter</h2>
<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Write a letter to a local leader about an issue in your area. Ask a trusted adult to help you find a name and address for your official. It is up to you and your parent or guardian whether you send the letter. In your letter, be sure to answer the following questions:<br /><br />
        What is the issue?<br />
        How is it an ecological issue?<br />
        How does it relate to conservation?<br />
        Why is it a problem in your area?<br />
        How is the government involved in this issue?<br />
        What can citizens do to help?</li>
    <li>Edit your letter. Check for spelling and grammar errors. Ask a trusted adult to read your work. Be sure your letter is in the business letter format shown below. You may use a pretend address for privacy. However, if you choose to send the letter to your local officials, you should use your real address so they can respond!<br /><br />
        <div class="indent"><br /><br />Your street address<br />
        Your city, state ZIP code<br />
        Date<br /><br />
        First and last name of the person to whom you are writing<br />
        That personâ€™s street address<br />
        Their city, state ZIP code<br /><br />
        Dear Mr./Ms. first and last name:<br /><br />
        This is the body of your letter. You should first introduce yourself. Be sure to write about all the topics required for your assignment. You want to persuade the person you are writing to, so include as many facts as possible. This helps support your opinions. Be respectful and kind. The person may have different opinions than you. He or she is taking the time to read your letter, so every sentence should make a point. Think about what concerns your reader may have and address them.<br /><br />
        In the second paragraph, offer your solutions or action plan. A complaint is only a complaint if you do not recommend a specific change. Remind your reader how to contact you. Thank them for their time in reading the letter.<br /><br />
        Sincerely yours,<br /><br />
        Your full name<br /><br /></div><br /></li>
      <li>Use a map to identify the area(s) in your local community affected by your chosen issue. You may use the map you created for your CAP file. Save your image to your computer.</li>
      <li>Make sure to save your letter and map to one file to turn in.</li>
    </ol>
