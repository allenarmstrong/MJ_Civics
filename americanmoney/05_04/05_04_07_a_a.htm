<h2>Goals: Answers Text Version</h2>

<p>Here is the correct order.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Jan and Jim go to a bank to deposit their savings.</li>
                <li>Jan and Jim see their savings grow as they add more cash and the bank awards interest on the account. They compare the loan interest rates of different banks.</li>
                <li>Jan and Jim go to the bank that they found has the lowest interest rate for loans. They ask for a business loan.</li>
                <li>The bank manager in charge of loans talks to Jan and Jim about their plans for a skate and surf shop. The manager grants a loan to Jan and Jim.</li>
                <li>Jan and Jim spend money from the loan to buy a store location. They buy supplies to clean, decorate, and set up the store. They hire a painter to paint the walls. </li>
                <li>Jan and Jim hold a grand opening of the shop. Customers purchase new boards and safety gear. The shop's income pays bills like electricity and new products. Jan and Jim begin to pay back the loan and put money aside for when business is slow.</li>
                <li>Once they pay off their loan a few years later, Jan and Jim begin saving some profits to open a second shop. They use some profits to purchase goods and services they want for themselves.</li>
                </ol>
