<h2>Ecology Map Text Version</h2>
<p>Acid rain is rainfall with low pH. The pH level tells you how much hydrogen is in the water. Acid rain can hurt plants, animals, and buildings. Air pollution from factories and cars is a main cause of acid rain. Locate the state you live in on the map. Compare the map key to your state. Is acid rain a problem in your area?  It is a greater problem in the Eastern United States than in the West.</p>

<p>Animals are important to the environment. Many are at risk for extinction, which means the species will be gone forever. The movement of people into new areas threatens them. People hunt animals for food and for sport. Building homes and stores destroys animal habitats. Locate where you live on this map. Do you live near the home of any endangered species?</p>

<p>Pesticides help improve the quality of many plants, including those we eat. They can prevent bugs or weeds from destroying crops. However, some of these chemicals can have harmful effects on humans, animals, and land. They absorb into the ground and can pollute the water supply. Locate where you live on this map. Is there heavy pesticide use in your area?  The heaviest use is near the center of the nation.</p>

<p>Many normal activities produce methane gas in small amounts. However, in large amounts, this gas can harm Earth's protective ozone layer. This layer helps protect us, and all of Earth, from the damaging rays of the sun. Landfills are the second-greatest producers of methane gas. The rotting garbage releases the gas. In this map, notice that many counties do not have estimates. Yet most U.S. counties have landfills. Look where you live. Do you live near an area with high methane releases?  The high estimates are concentrated along the coastlines.</p>

<p>Many Americans are concerned about our energy resources. Fossil fuels like oil and natural gas are nonrenewable. We cannot make or grow nonrenewable resources. Some people are turning to solar or wind power to produce energy. This map shows average daily sunlight hours across the United States. Look where you live. Do you think solar power is a good option for your area? The Southwestern United States receives the most sunlight.</p>
