<h2>Supply and Demand Text Version</h2>
<h3>Image One</h3>
<p>A store by the beach with the owner stocking extra sunscreen on a very bright day.  Store owner's thinking "I bet many people will want sunscreen today! Good thing I ordered more than usual. With a larger supply, I can lower my price a bit and make more sales."</p>
<h3>Image Two</h3>
<p>A bunch of very red people rushing to the store with money in hand. Store owner's thinking "Oh wow, more people than I thought need sunscreen! Demand has increased from the usual! I can charge more and earn more money!"</p>
<h3>Image Three</h3>
<p>Storeowner is reading a newspaper headline that says, "Sunscreen Mishap Blows Up Factory." The storeowner thinks "Yikes, looks like I won't be able to order more sunscreen for awhile with the supply down. I will raise my prices for what I have left."</p>
<h3>Image Four</h3>
<p>Now there is a thunder and lightning storm. Storeowner thinks "Oh no â€¦ with this weather, no one has been buying sunscreen anywhere. Demand is down. I better lower my prices even more to try and sell off what I have."</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>When the supply for a good or service goes down, the price tends to rise, or increase. When the sunscreen grew more scarce, it was more valuable. The opposite is also true. When supply increases, price tends to fall.</p>
<p>When the demand for a good or service goes down, the price tends to go down, or decrease. When people were less willing to buy the sunscreen, prices fell to try to make more sales. The opposite is also true. When demand increases, price tends to increase.</p>
