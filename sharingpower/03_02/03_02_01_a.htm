<h2>Jackie's Move Text Version</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Jackie! Last year I moved to Florida from another state. It was difficult to leave my friends, but I have made new ones here. I keep in touch online with friends from my old hometown.</p>
<p>Though both states are part of the United States, they have many differences. The weather is different, but so are the laws.</p>
<p>For example, the laws about riding bicycles are different. I used to ride my bicycle all the time in my hometown. In my new town, I have to be home by a curfew and must wear a helmet!</p>
<p>I never had to wear a helmet in my old town. When I told that to a local officer, he said I have to follow the rules here and buy myself a helmet. I understand it's for safety, but, well, they just don't look cool. I made mine better, though, with glitter glue and stickers. I even made friends when people started asking me to decorate their helmets!</p>
<p>Before I moved, all my concern was about leaving my friends and making new ones. Now I realize that differences between U.S. states can create other changes in people's lives when they move. I had no idea!</p>
