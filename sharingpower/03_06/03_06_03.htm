<h1>What Are the Levels of the Court System?</h1>
<p>The United States has two levels in its court system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>state</li>
    <li>federal</li>
  </ul>
<p>The <span class="tooltip">U.S. Constitution<span><strong>U.S. Constitution:</strong> plan detailing the structure, functions, and powers of the government of the United States, also known as the Constitution</span></span> names only one court of the <span class="tooltip">judicial branch<span><strong>Judicial Branch:</strong> the part of government responsible for interpreting the laws and settling disputes</span></span>, the <span class="tooltip">U.S. Supreme Court<span><strong>U.S. Supreme Court:</strong> the name for the highest court in the United States, or court of last resort, hears cases related to the U.S. Constitution</span></span>. It gives <span class="tooltip">Congress<span><strong>Congress:</strong> official name for the legislative branch of the U.S. government </span></span> the power to create inferior courts, including setting rules for how the states set up their own courts as necessary.</p>
<p>The structure of the federal and state court systems is very similar. At both levels, <span class="tooltip">trials<span><strong>Trial:</strong> a formal legal process in court to settle disputes or determine the guilt or innocence of those accused of crimes</span></span> will begin in the court of <span class="tooltip">original jurisdiction<span><strong>Original Jurisdiction:</strong> having the right to hear a case the first time it is presented in court</span></span>. States may have different courts of original jurisdiction, including <span class="tooltip">district<span><strong>District:</strong> a geographic division for administrative or other government purposes</span></span> courts and courts for specific situations like traffic tickets. States may split their district courts into separate courts to hear <span class="tooltip">criminal cases<span><strong>Criminal Case:</strong> a lawsuit brought before a court involving someone who is accused of committing a crime </span></span> and <span class="tooltip">civil cases<span><strong>Civil Case:</strong> a lawsuit brought before a court relating to the rights of citizens, usually a dispute between citizens or groups</span></span>. The federal court of original jurisdiction is the U.S. District Court.</p> 
<p>An <span class="tooltip">appeal<span><strong>Appeal:</strong> formal request to a higher authority requesting a change of decision, such as a case to a higher court</span></span> of the trial decision would go to an <span class="tooltip">appellate court<span><strong>Appellate Court:</strong> the jurisdiction to hear case appeals and review the decisions of lower courts, also known as a court of appeal</span></span>, or court of appeals. If requested, judges in the court of last resort may choose to review the case and related laws. Many states name their highest court a "supreme court," but not all. The U.S. Supreme Court is the highest court, or the court of final authority over all other courts, state or federal. This court may hear cases from not only federal courts of appeal, but also cases appealed from a state's supreme court.</p>
