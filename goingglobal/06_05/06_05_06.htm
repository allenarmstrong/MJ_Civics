<h1>Who Decides Foreign Policy?</h1>
<p>The U.S. president has the most <span class="tooltip">influence<span><strong>Influence:</strong> to have an effect on something</span></span> over foreign policy. Advisors in several departments give the president information and advice. One example is the <span class="tooltip">U.S. Department of State<span><strong>U.S. Department of State:</strong> executive department of the United States responsible for relations with other countries, also known as the State Department</span></span>.  The <span class="tooltip">Secretary of State<span><strong>U.S. Secretary of State:</strong> the official position in the United States as head of the Department of State</span></span> is an important official to foreign policy because he or she meets with leaders of other countries. The <span class="tooltip">U.S. Constitution<span><strong>U.S. Constitution:</strong> plan detailing the structure, functions, and powers of the government of the United States, also known as the Constitution</span></span> states the president is the leader of the armed forces. He or she can send troops into a conflict. The president can make treaties with other countries. He or she appoints <span class="tooltip">ambassadors<span><strong>Ambassador:</strong> an official sent by one country to be its representative in another country</span></span> and other federal officials.</p> 
<p>The Constitution gives Congress certain powers that deal with foreign policy. Though the president is the leader of the military, only Congress can declare war. The Senate, one part of Congress, must approve treaties with foreign countries. It also must approve people the president appoints. Congress must approve how the president spends the federal budget.</p>
<p>U.S. leaders must pay attention to people's opinions and concerns. Like with domestic policy, their job is to represent the people in foreign policy. This includes people outside the United States. What others think about the country will affect its relationship with other countries. Foreign policy affects the lives of people within the United States. Many groups, especially businesses that compete with foreign companies, contact officials about foreign policy.</p>
