  <h3>How can technology help us compare data?</h3>
  <p>Lesson 1 of 6: <br /><br />
    Imagine you want to find out whether your community builds schools in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of residents. You plan to compare population density in your community with school locations. You find a map of schools in your area. <br />
  <br />
    However, the population-density map you find shows the whole country. Your community is too small to see. You wish you could lay the maps on top of each other for easy comparison, but because the map is not transparent, it is a pointless effort. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Map Layering</strong>, which includes multiple data sets in a map for comparison, technology comes to the rescue! <br />
  <br />
    (Image contains three elements; each is a photo of a young woman studying the maps discussed in this lesson. The top picture is an overhead view of the girl looking at the country's population-density map in her left hand and the map of the schools in the right. The middle picture shows the young woman from the side and shows her frustration, looking at the population-density map and the same can be said for the bottom picture, the student is holding both maps, school map in left and population-density in her right.)</p>

  <h3>Map Layering</h3>
    Lesson 2 of 6:<br /><br />
    Computer software and databases allow us to collect information and display it on maps. We can layer multiple data sets to find relationships between them, like population densities with school locations. Try this activity to experience the potential of map layering. <br />
    Interactive Map:<br />
    <br />
    Step 1 of 9:<br />
    (Image is a blank map of the United States, there are no individual state borders. The map is shaded light brown in the middle and gets a darker shade towards the country's borders.)<br />
    <br />
    In layering applications, this plain starting map is called the &quot;base map.&quot; Choose one set of data to layer on the base map. Then click Redraw to see your new map.<br />
    Layers:</h3>
  <p>Air Releases: (Image shows the base map with purple dots to show locations of Air Releases within the country. They are heavily concentrated in the northeast and especially heavy in coastal or water areas. There are also some concentrations throughout the rest of the central and southern states, with little concentration towards the west.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! You added one layer of data to the base map. You can choose Clear Layers to start over and examine the other layers one at a time, of click next to continue.</p>
  <p>Major Cities: (Image shows the base map with the following cities labeled with red dots beside them; Miami, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, New York City, Washington, and Atlanta.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! You added one layer of data to the base map. You can choose Clear Layers to start over and examine the other layers one at a time, of click next to continue.</p>
  <p>State Borders: (Image shows the base map with each individual state's borders.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! You added one layer of data to the base map. You can choose Clear Layers to start over and examine the other layers one at a time, of click next to continue.</p>
  <p>Nighttime Lights: (Image shows the base map but is now black instead of brown to represent the absence of sunlight. We can also see that there are pink dots being used to show the lighting from cities. The areas to the northeast are the most heavily colored, with thick concentrations through the coastal areas. There is still a thick concentration from the east coast through to the center of the country but then, noticeably thins out. Reaching the west coast, we see the concentrations return.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! You added one layer of data to the base map. You can choose Clear Layers to start over and examine the other layers one at a time, of click next to continue.</p>
  <p>Population Density: (Image shows the base map and is now colored various shades of blue in the northeast, along coastlines, and throughout the central United States. There are also various shades of green and yellow, the coloring begins as a green on the east coast and begins to change to a yellow near the central United States. On the west coast we see blue patches in the north and south.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! You added one layer of data to the base map. You can choose Clear Layers to start over and examine the other layers one at a time, of click next to continue.</p>
  <p>Airports: (Image shows the base map and small black airplane images to represent the airports across the United States. Heavy concentrations are placed on the coastal areas in the northeast and then are fairly spread out through the remaining area, there are some heavy concentrations on the south and southwestern coasts.)<br /><br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! You added one layer of data to the base map. You can choose Clear Layers to start over and examine the other layers one at a time, of click next to continue.</p>
  <p>Step 2 of 9:<br />
    Map layering applications pull data from multiple sources. This time, try layering two comparable sets of data. Select Redraw to see your new map.<br />
    (Image shows the base map with the two selected layers that you have chosen to draw on the map.)<br />
    <br />
    Step 3 of 9:<br />
    Try selecting all the data sets. Select Redraw to see your new map.<br />
    <br />
    (Image shows the base map and we see a number of the layers overlapping each other. This overlapping is blocking other data from being seen.)</p>
  <p>Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Yes, you followed the directions! However, this map is difficult to read, and even harder to understand. Too much information on a map is not a good thing. Cartographers limit data layers in their maps to protect their ease of use. Click Next to continue.<br />
    <br />
    Step 4 of 9:<br />
    When choosing data to layer on maps, cartographers and other users of layering software ask themselves what they are trying to discover. Imagine you would like to see where the United States has the most intense lighting at night. Choose the data set that would help you see this information and select Redraw to see your map.<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! Images of Earth at night, from satellite photos, are fascinating to study. Can you identify the brightest cities? Click Next to continue.<br /><br />
    Step 5 of 9:<br />
    Now imagine you wish to see which state in the United States has the most airports. Choose the layers of data that would help you and select Redraw.<br />
    (Image shows the base map with the two selected layers that you have chosen to draw on the map.)<br /><br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! &quot;State Borders&quot; and &quot;Airports&quot; are the two data sets that could best help you with this topic. Click Next to continue.</p>
  <p>Step 6 of 9:<br />
    Imagine you would like to see whether areas with greater air pollutants also have greater numbers of people living nearby. Choose the layers of data sets that would help you answer this question, and select Redraw.<br />
    <br />
    (Image shows the base map with the two selected layers that you have chosen to draw on the map.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! &quot;Air Releases&quot; and &quot;Population Density&quot; are the two data sets that could help you study this topic. Click Next to continue. <br /><br />
    Step 7 of 9:<br />
    Now imagine you want to know which of the areas of the United States have polluted waters/ Choose the layers of data that would help you answer this question, and click Redraw.<br />
    <br />
    (Image shows the base map with the selected layer that you have chosen to draw on the map.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    We have the data set showing sites emitting air pollutants but no data layers related to water. When a map does not have the information you are looking for, you must consult other maps or resources. Click Next to continue.<br />
    <br />
    Step 8 of 9:<br />
    Layer population density over state borders and select Redraw. What do you notice?<br />
    <br />
    (Image shows the base map with the two selected layers that you have chosen to draw on the map.)<br />
    <br />
    Feedback upon selection:<br />
    Excellent! You created the correct map. Notice that states along the coasts are the most densely populated, such as Rhode Island and New Jersey. Overall, the eastern half of the continental United States is more densely populated. Click Next to continue.<br />
    <br />
    Step 9 of 9:<br />
    Good work! We made our points about layering maps. Take some time to explore these data sets on your own before moving on.<br />
    <br />
    (Image shows the base map with the selected layer(s) that you have chosen to draw on the map.<br /><br />

    <h3>Values and Limitations</h3>
          Lesson 3 of 6:<br /><br />
        Layering maps has both values and limitations for those using the applications. You should have discovered a few key points about layering maps.<br />
        <br />
      (Image is a bullet list of text with the following statements)<br />
        <br />
        <u>Layered Maps:</u><br />
        <ul>
      <li> are a powerful tool for learning about an area<br />
        <br />
       <li>allow you to easily compare data maps<br />
         <br />
        <li>allow you to discover relationships between different characteristics of an area<br />
          <br />
       <li>limit data to what you need to see, which makes the map easier to study<br />
         <br />
       <li>use data layers that do not cover each other or will not be visible at the same time       <br />
         <br />
         <li>may not have all the data you need to answer a specific question and may require additional resources</h3>

        <h3>Applications of Layered Maps</h3>
          <p>Lesson 4 of 6:<br /><br />
          Layered maps have many applications, or ways you can use the information the show. Imagine you wish to open your own business. You want to make a fun, safe place for teens to hang out with their friends. Some areas already have plenty of recreational spots available for teens. You figure that going to an area that offers little means you will receive the most business.<br />
          <br />
          Roll your cursor over this map to find which areas on this map may be best for your business.<br />
          (Image is a map of a town; it is laid out with a grid dividing the map into sections. Columns across the top are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; and rows going down the left side are A, B, C, D. Beginning in column 1 we see a water park in sections A1 and B1, and a movie theater in C1 and D1. Column A2 is empty. B2 and B3 contain a skate park. C2 and C3 have a roller rink and there is a mall covering D2, D3, and D4. A3, A4, and B4 have sports fields and C4 shows an ice cream shop. Finally there is a bowling alley in A5, a dance hall in B5, nothing in C5, and an arcade located in D5.)<br />
          <br />
          Feedback upon selection:<br />
          Notice how the areas in A2 and C5 have few or no recreational spots for teens. These areas might be great for your business!<br />

          <h3>A Note on Data</h3>
            Lesson 5 of 6:<br /><br />
            Cartographers can use map layers to show quantitative and qualitative data sets. Qualitative data is something you can see and describe but not measure. Quantitative data is measurable in terms using numbers. The amount of data a cartographer could show in a map is infinite.<br />
            Remember that the cartographer will choose what data to include and how to display it so the map is useful and attractive. For example, the cartographer may generalize the data to a larger category, like showing population density by state instead of county. These choices affect whether a data layer will meet your needs.<br />
            <br />
            Move over a hotspot for more information:<br />
            <br />
            (Image is a map of Europe showing most of the countries which make up the continent, we can see the southern tip of Ireland and eastern border of Spain. The countries are labeled by name and borders. The Map is colored 2 different shades of green throughout the eastern and northern areas of the continent. As we move towards the center of the map, near the Mediterranean Sea, we can see that there are shades of tan, light brown, and dark brown. These colors indicate changes in elevation, possibly mountain ranges. Hot spots are located in the country of Italy, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine. We see coast lines bordering the northern and western areas of the map a)<br />
            <br />
            Hotspot descriptions:</h3>
          <p>Italy: Qualitative; The outline of Italy resembles a boot.<br />
            <br />
            Switzerland: Qualitative; Switzerland is a mountainous region. Quantitative; Switzerland has zero miles of coastline.<br />
            <br />
            Czech Republic: Quantitative; The Czech Republic shares a border with four nations.<br />
            <br />
            Ukraine: Qualitative; The map is simple and attractive, showing the physical features of Europe's nations.. Quantitative; The maps uses five colors to show elevation differences.</p>

  <li>Map &quot;C&quot; (Image of a map which is identical to &quot;A&quot;. We now can see labels for the countries. India, China, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam make up the northern land mass. The southern land mass is Australia and the islands making up the middle of the map are Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and East Timor. The water is also named and labeled as the Indian Ocean in the south west, the Philippine Sea in the north east.)<br />

  <li>Map &quot;D&quot; (Image of a map which is identical to &quot;C&quot;. We can now see oil platforms shown on the map in locations such as Indonesia (3) and Thailand (1). Each platform represents 10,000 barrels of oil produced each day.)<br />

  <li>Map &quot;A&quot; (Image of a map of unnamed land. The map has a large body of land in the north and a smaller but still large body of land in the southeast corner. Separating the land masses is a body of water with a number of islands which almost create a connection between the large masses. The map does have color and shading differences showing elevation changes. The map also shows lines of longitude and latitude. )<br />

  <li>Map &quot;B&quot; (Image of a map of the same bodies of land as &quot;A&quot; but is colored one shade of green. We now can see labels for the countries. India, China, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam make up the northern land mass. The southern land mass is Australia and the islands making up the middle of the map are Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and East Timor. The water is also named and labeled as the Indian Ocean in the south west, the Philippine Sea in the north east.)<br />
