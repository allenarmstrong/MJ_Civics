<h2>Principal Conversation Text Version</h2>
<p>[Sarah] Hey Mr. Jameson.</p>
<p>[Principal Jameson] Sarah ... Jaden, how may I help you today?</p>
<p>[Sarah] We have some concerns about the school's trash.</p>
<p>[Jaden] The paper kind.</p>
<p>[Principal Jameson] I see and what are your concerns?</p>
<p>[Sarah] We believe staff and students would think twice about wasting paper, if they understood all of the ways it affected our society.</p>
<p>[Jaden] Yeah, throwing away a piece of paper affects more than that on sheet.</p>
<p>[Sarah] Paper is a basic tool of our society. We don't wish to stop using paper and lose jobs, we just simply wish to reduce the impact of negative externalities<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>[Principal Jameson] So what were you ideas?</p>
<p>[Jaden] I thought we might get a recycling company to put bins outside of each teacher's door for waste paper.</p>
<p>[Sarah] And I thought we could put a quota<sup>2</sup> on the copy machine for the printer paper for every staff member.</p>
<p>[Jaden] I thought we could encourage teachers to have a designated student in each class, that takes notes from the chalk or whiteboard and emails them to the rest of the class. The same could be done with handouts instead of making copies for everyone.</p>
<p>[Sarah] Uh huh! And I thought the school could purchase laptops for every classs room to be used by the students in class.</p>
<p>[Principal Jameson] Hmm! Quite a few ideas there.</p>
<p>[Sarah] I thought you might say that.</p>
<p>[Principal Jameson] I think we can implement the first two ideas. And there is enough money in the budget to implement the recycling idea. And it would provide a visual reminder as to why these quotas are so important.</p>
<p>[Jaden] We didn't even think of that.</p>
<p>[Principal Jameson] Let me work on some figures. You kids work on some promotional ideas that will catch staff and student attention. I think if we start small by setting quota not much lower then typical current use, people won't bark. Over time we can lower the quota. Over time, savings from paper quota will help offset the cost of the recycling program ... hmmm!</p>
<p>[Sarah] I love it. Let's do it.</p>
<p>[Jaden] Absolutely. Thank you for your time Mr. Jameson.</p>
<p>[Principal Jameson] Thank you kids. You have great ideas for helping the school and society.</p>
<p>[Sarah] By Mr. Jameson.</p>
<p>[Principal Jameson] Have a great day.</p>
