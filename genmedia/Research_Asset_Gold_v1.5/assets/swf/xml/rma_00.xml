		 <node id="1"><![CDATA[Dear Alicia, <br><br>I heard a story the other day that I think you might want to consider putting on the school news tomorrow morning. It's pretty amazing! <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Paul<br><br>Early last year firefighters battled raging flames in northern California, as nearly a third of a beloved national forest burned to the ground. After weeks of round-the-clock efforts, the firefighters finally contained the deadly flames and saved the rest of the trees and habitats. California residents were thrilled, and a relief effort began nearly immediately to clean up and restore the damaged forest. Imagine the surprise and confusion when one of the cleanup volunteers (a graduate from our high school) found the charred remains of a scuba diver – wearing full scuba gear – in one of the blackened branches of a sycamore tree! <br><br>How did this happen?<br><br>Authorities puzzled over the mystery for several days before they identified the body as that of a world-renowned scuba diver. He had been diving off the California coast during the raging fire, but he had not entered the woods to anyone's knowledge.<br><br>Finally, investigations showed that the diver had been caught in a bucket as fire-fighting helicopters pulled water from the ocean to put out the flames. One moment the diver was enjoying his favorite pastime, and the next he was being dropped into a burning tree!]]></node>
