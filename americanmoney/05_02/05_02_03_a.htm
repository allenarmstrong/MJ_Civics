<h2>1994 - Jerry Yang Co-founds Yahoo!</h2>

<p>Back in the early 1990s a brand new system of connecting people and information electronically sprang up almost overnight, literally out of nothing; it was the Internet. It had hundreds of cool web sites with lots of information, but finding them was hit or miss and could take hours. The question was, could anyone build a business model that would make the Internet profitable? Then, a Stanford electrical engineering graduate student had a brilliant idea - create a computerized database, a general directory of information that anyone could use to locate sites on the Web by subject. The man who came up with the idea was Chinese American Jerry Yang.</p>

<p>Jerry Yang was born in Taipei, Taiwan on November 6th, 1968. At age 10, his family moved to San Jose, California. A bright young man, by age 22 Jerry received a master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University. It was while he was going for his Ph.D. that he became friends with David Filo, the other genius behind Yahoo. Between them in 1994 they engineered what they called "Yahoo!" which Yang and Filo insist they took from <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> by Jonathan Swift: Yahoo—rude, unsophisticated, uncouth. </p>

<p>Within a year, the two of them incorporated, built a search engine, had a public offering to raise millions, and built themselves one of the first Internet Web portals. Web portals present information from diverse sources in a unified way. Tied to their search engine, it offered other services such as email, news, stock prices, infotainment, and other features. With millions of Web surfers coming to Yahoo's single site each day, this offered the opportunity for millions of dollars in ad revenue; a way to monetize the Internet. This brilliant combination of steps proved to be the business model that formed the nexus of the Internet, or .com, boom. A major business and communication event for which Jerry Yang will forever be commemorated as its foremost pioneer.</p>

<p>One of the latest Chinese Americans to take advantage of the Internet's endless opportunities is Steve Chen who, in 2005, co-founded YouTube—the popular video sharing web site. As a result of their entrepreneurialism, Chen and Yang are two of the richest men in the country. </p>
