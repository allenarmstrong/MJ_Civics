<h2>Self-Check Part Two Text Version</h2>
<h3>Part Two</h3>
<p>(Image of a stock certificate.)</p>
<p>[Jim] Do banks have any other products or ways they make money besides loans?</p>
<p>[Narrator] Yes, Jim. Banks offer all kinds of ways for people to save and earn interest on their money. Banks also invest in the stock market.</p>
<p>[Jan] What's the stock market?</p>
<p>[Narrator] First, let me explain stock. A stock is a share of ownership in a company, such as your shop. A person who owns stock gets a share of the profits that the business earns. If the business loses money, however, so does the owner of the stock. The stock market is the buying and selling of shares of stock in different companies. Banks buy and sell stocks too.</p>
<p>[Jim] Could we sell shares of stock in our company instead of getting a loan?</p>
<p>(Image of a happy person holding a stock certificate with money in the other hand, and a sad person holding a stock certificate with no money.)</p>
<p>[Narrator] Well, there are many laws and regulations for the stock market. In addition, the stock market depends on supply and demand. People are not going to buy shares of stock in a company that does not yet exist. Businesses sell stock to raise the money to grow their business. Buying and selling stock is a risk. When successful, businesses grow and help the economy by creating more jobs and products. Perhaps that could be an option to expand your shop in the future. If you do, you will have to share any profits you earn as well from the surf shop.</p> 
<p>[Jim] <strong>Skate</strong> and surf shopâ€¦</p>
<p>[Narrator] Oh, right, sorry.</p> 
<p>(Image of Jim and Jan on the phone.)</p>
<p>[Jan] Jim, we should start calling banks and see what interest rates they charge for loans. Perhaps we should ask what they give for savings, too. What if we deposit our savings in a bank and want it back a few days later? Would the bank lend it to someone so we couldn't get it back?</p>
<p>(Image of money going into the bank, some flowing into a vault and most flowing out to people, businesses, and to stocks.)</p>
<p>[Narrator] The Federal Reserve requires banks to keep a portion of its deposited money available to customers. While most deposits are transferred to loans, some stay at the bank so people can take their money out and spend it.</p>
<p>[Jim] The Fed sounds like it is a kind of protector. An economic super hero!</p>
<p>(Image of money going into the bank, most flowing into a vault and some flowing out to people, businesses, and to stocks)</p>
<p>[Narrator] I agree, Jim. The Fed can change the rules for the banks to increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation, called the money supply. The more loans a bank makes, the more money that is in circulation. If a bank makes fewer loans, the money supply decreases.</p>
<p>(Image of a bank with a sign saying "Loans Available" layered with a newspaper headline saying "More new businesses opening than last year".)</p>
<p>[Jan] How does the money supply affect the economy?</p>
<p>[Narrator] Well, with an increased money supply, more businesses can open and more jobs will become available. People will buy more goods and services, leading to growth.</p>
<p>[Jim] What's the down side?</p>
<p>[Narrator] Too much growth can lead to inflation, meaning a rise in prices over time.</p>
<p>[Jim] Oh, is that like how my first helmet at age four cost five dollars and the one I have now cost thirty dollars?</p>
<p>[Narrator] Yes, prices rise over time. Good thing your mother insists you wear a sturdy helmet!</p>
<p>[Jim] Hey! She's just overprotective!</p>
<p>[Jan] No, she's not. He's always busting something. Jim needs a bubble.</p>
<p>[Narrator] Funny you should mention bubbles. When the economy grows too much too fast, people say there's a bubble. The bad thing is bubbles can burst. Economies can downturn quickly.</p>
<p>[Jan] So I guess the Fed does not always want to increase the money supply.</p>
<p>(Image of a newspaper headline "Interest rates are up! Banks making fewer loans!")</p>
<p>[Narrator] Right. The Fed can control growth by changing the rules for banks so the banks make fewer loans and save more of the deposited money. That decreases the money in circulation. See, the value of currency is based on supply and demand. The more money that is available, the less value it has and prices go up. When less is available, meaning more scarce, its value rises.</p>
<p>[Jim] So it's not a guarantee that we can get a loan. Bummer.</p>
<p>(Image of a loan application.)</p>
<p>[Narrator] This is true. It depends on whether the bank is making loans for the amount you request. It also depends on whether the bank thinks your business will succeed and whether you are likely to pay the money back. Remember, the bank is making money from the loan but not if you don't pay it back.</p>
<p>(Image of Jan and Jim smiling and waving goodbye)</p> 
<p>[Jim] Right, I wouldn't want that kind of trouble. I see loans are a serious business. Jan, we have a lot of investigating and planning to do.</p>
<p>[Jan] I agree, Jim. Thanks so much for all your help, Mrs. Voice!</p>
<p>[Jim] Yea, thanks!</p>
<p>[Narrator] You're welcome, Jim and Jan.</p>
