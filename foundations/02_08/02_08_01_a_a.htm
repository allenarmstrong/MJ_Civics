<h2>Picture Quiz: Answer Text Version</h2>
<p>There is a black and white photo of voters lined up at the polls that includes women and African Americans. When would you estimate the photo was taken?</p>
<p>1840—Nice try! By 1840, most white male Americans could vote, but no other groups of people. In addition, note that photography was rare at this point.<br />
1870—Not quite! By 1870, male Americans, including African Americans, could vote according to the Constitution. However, few African Americans could exercise the right at this time because of state laws.<br /> 
1900—Close! By 1900, as in 1870, American males could vote according to the Constitution. Laws in most states still excluded women and African Americans. Photography, however, was a growing technology.<br />
<strong>1930—Yes! By 1930, the Constitution protected the right of all Americans to vote, both male and female. It would still be many years, though, before women and African Americans would vote in large numbers.</strong></p>
