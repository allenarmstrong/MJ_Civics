<h2>21st Amendment Text Version</h2>
<p>Article V (Five) of the Constitution describes two main steps to amend the Constitution. The first is "proposal." If two-thirds of Congress votes to propose the amendment idea, that means lawmakers will officially research and debate the idea. They will agree on official wording for the amendment. Congress proposed the first 27 amendments this way, but there is another method for proposal. Two-thirds of state legislatures request a national convention. Then, two-thirds of attendees to that convention can vote for proposal. This method has not been used.</p>
<p>The next step is ratification. The states are the main players in this step. Three-quarters of the states must vote yes to ratify the amendment. Usually, the state legislatures vote on whether to ratify. Only once has three-quarters of special state conventions ratified an amendment, the 21st.</p>
