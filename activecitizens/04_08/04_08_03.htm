<h1>How Is the U.S. President Selected?</h1>
<p>The <span class="tooltip">Founding Fathers<span><strong>Founding Fathers:</strong> name given to the early leaders of the United States who helped design the nation's government</span></span> were concerned about voter ability to choose the best candidate for the nation's highest office. Most Americans in the late 1700s could not read and had little access to information about government. At that time, the work of government was believed to be the work of the most wealthy and educated members of society. The majority of people were farmers and did not think it was appropriate to be involved.   Aware of these concerns, the Founding Fathers created the <span class="tooltip">Electoral College<span><strong>Electoral College:</strong> the group of people who officially elect the president of the United States</span></span>. The <span class="tooltip">U.S. Constitution<span><strong>U.S. Constitution:</strong> plan detailing the structure, functions, and powers of the government of the United States, also known as the Constitution</span></span> provides the Electoral College as a way to select the president.</p>
<p>In this system, people chosen to be electors from each state cast their vote for president. Each state's number of electors is based on the state's population. For example, Florida has more electoral votes than Maine because it has more people living there. Today, a candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the election.</p>
<p>In most states today, the electors are bound by law to select the candidate who wins the most <span class="tooltip">popular votes<span><strong>Popular vote:</strong> a vote of the majority of the people in a country</span></span>, the votes of the people. However, because of the varying number of electors by state, it is possible for a candidate to lose the popular vote nationwide but still win the election.</p>
