<h2>Legislative Choices Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Make choices like a real legislator and answer some questions about the process.</p>
<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>Imagine you are a member of the Florida House of Representatives. You receive a few letters of concern about an incident that happened in the district you serve. A very rude text message sent to many students caused disruption in classrooms during school hours. School officials tracked down and punished the students responsible. School district officials and many others wish for a state law to prevent such an event in the future. What do you do?</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s1c1" title="Scenario 1 - Choice 1">Choice 1:</a> Ignore the letters and emails. The school district should handle it themselves.</li>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s1c2" title="Scenario 1 - Choice 2">Choice 2:</a> Introduce a bill to ban use of electronic devices in school.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>Your bill is written, given a code for reference, and read to the legislature. A council of members is trying to decide which committee should work on the bill. Which committee should consider your bill?</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s2c1" title="Scenario 2 - Choice 1">Choice 1:</a> Education Committee</li>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s2c2" title="Scenario 2 - Choice 2">Choice 2:</a> Criminal and Civil Justice Policy Council</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 3</h4>
<p>Imagine you are a member of the Education Committeee. The Education Committee hold a hearing on the bill. Which group of witnesses to the hearing would be most likely to support the bill?</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s3c1" title="Scenario 3 - Choice 1">Choice 1:</a> American Civil Liberties Union</li>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s3c2" title="Scenario 3 - Choice 2">Choice 2:</a> Florida School Boards Association</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 4</h4>
<p>The Education Committee reads the bill again. Some members of the committee are concerned that your bill is too general to gain support from enough citizens, including some school officials. They want to amend, or change, it to be more specific to what the citizens want. Which change would you support?</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s4c1" title="Scenario 4 - Choice 1">Choice 1:</a> "Use of electronic devices in schools is prohibited, except for devices approved for educational purposes."</li>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s4c2" title="Scenario 4 - Choice 2">Choice 2:</a> "Use of electronic devices in schools by students is prohibited during school hours."</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 5</h4>
<p>A majority of Education Committee members approve the amended bill and sends it to the Rules and Calendar Council. The council places the bill on the calendar for meetings of the entire House. At the scheduled time, the bill is read to the House for the second time, though now it is a bit different. Some representatives still have concerns. Which change would you support this time?</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s5c1" title="Scenario 5 - Choice 1">Choice 1:</a> "Use of electronic devices in school is prohibited, except for devices used by teachers for instruction. Student use of electronic devices may be allowed in situations to be determined by the school district."</li>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s5c2" title="Scenario 5 - Choice 2">Choice 2:</a> "Use of electronic devices in school is prohibited, except for computers and televisions used by teachers for instruction."</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 6</h4>
<p>With the new change, the majority of Florida House members approve the bill. The Florida Senate passed a similar bill, but it was different. The Conference Committee, made up of representatives and senators, meets to rewrite a bill that satisfies the changes made in both the House and Senate. The compromise bill goes to each chamber for a new vote. The Florida Senate has 40 members and the Florida House has 120 members. How many members in each chamber must vote in support of the bill to pass it?</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s6c1" title="Scenario 6 - Choice 1">Choice 1:</a> Two-thirds, so at least 27 senators and 80 representatives</li>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s6c2" title="Scenario 6 - Choice 2">Choice 2:</a> A majority, so at least 21 senators and 61 representatives</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 7</h4>
<p>Your bill passes both the Florida House and Senate. Now the passed bill goes to the governor. What may the governor do?</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s7c1" title="Scenario 7 - Choice 1">Choice 1:</a> Veto the bill</li>
  <li><a href="03_04_07_a_a.htm#s7c2" title="Scenario 7 - Choice 2">Choice 2:</a> Sign it into law</li>
</ul>
