<p>Lesson 1 of 5:</p>
<p>How can we display Earth on a map with the most accuracy?
  Examine the Maps to determine the most accurate view of the world.
  (Image in this lesson has 4 interactive maps each will open a new page with detailed information. The top left map is titled “Mercator,” the upper right is titled “Robinson,” the lower left is “Polar,” and the lower right is “Albers.”) </p>

  <h2>Map 1 of 4: </h2>
  <p>Mercator
    
    Description:
    The Mercator map looks accurate, but land area appears bigger than it really is as you move away from the equator.
    Type & Distortion:
    Mercator is a type of cylindrical (cylinder) projection. Lines of latitude and longitude intersect at right (90 degree) angles.
    Large land shapes and area are distorted. Distance is most accurate closest to the equator. Direction is true between any two points.
    Best For:
    The Mercator projection is best for navigation or mapping areas close to the equator.
    (Image is a map with all the Earth’s continents. North is positioned at the top of the map. Lines of longitude run parallel to each other top to bottom; lines of latitude run parallel to each other left to right. If this map were to be rolled around a can, the lines of latitude would meet up.)
  </p>

    <h2>Map 2 of 4: </h2>
    <p>Robinson
      
      Description:
      This Robinson map also looks accurate. It looks better by representing the worlds land shape closer to how it appears on a globe.
      Type & Distortion:
      Robinson is a type of pseudo-cylindrical projection. The lines of longitude or meridians, curve away from the central meridian. Land closer to the poles has less distortion of size and shape than it does in a Mercator projection. There is more distortion of distance and direction, however.
      Best For:
      Robinson projections are common in school settings and popular publications.
      (Image is a map with all the Earth’s continents; the map is shaped similarly to an oval, with straight edges on the top and bottom. North is positioned at the top of the map. Lines of longitude curve away from each other when moving away from the center of this map. Lines of latitude run parallel to each other left to right.)    </p>

  <h2>Map 3 of 4: </h2>
  <p>Polar
    
    Description:
    These polar maps make lands closer to the equator look very large. Polar maps show land near Earth’s poles with more accuracy.
    Type & Distortion:
    Polar Maps are a type of planar (plane) projection. Lines of longitude radiate out from the center point like spokes while lines of latitude curve. Direction is correct only from the center point. Size and distance distortion increase closer to the equator.
    Best For:
    Polar maps appear where an accurate representation of the arctic and Antarctic regions is important.
    (Image is a map with the Earth’s continents that are north of the Equator, the map is circular. Lines of latitude create rings that circle around the map. Lines of longitude look like spokes of a wheel connecting in the center of the map. We see North America on the left, Eurasia on the right. The northern tip of South America and Africa can be seen, but look much larger than other continents.) </p>

    <h2>Map 4 of 4: </h2>
    <p>Albers
      
      Description:
      This Albers map looks most accurate in the middle latitudes, like where the United States lies. It shows areas that are longer in the east/west direction with more accuracy.
      Type & Distortion:
      Albers is a type of conic (cone) projection. Lines of latitude curve, and lines of longitude appear as spokes. Distance and direction are accurate in limited areas. Shape is most accurate in the mid-latitudes.
      Best For:
      Albers maps are best for showing large countries in the mid-latitudes, like the United States. Cartographers prefer this projection for thematic maps.
      (Image is a map with the Earth’s continents, except Antarctica. This map is similar to the Polar map but instead there is a void, or hole in the center of the circle, there is also a section taken from the top of the circle approximately 1/5th.)

    <h2>A Little Geometry</h2>
    <p>Lesson 2 of 5:</p>
    <p>Examine these images to learn how cartographers use geometric shapes to create maps.
      (Image is three part image which is interactive. Top image is a box with the word Cylinder, and an image of a globe. Next to the globe is a cylinder. The middle image is another box with the word Cone, and an image of a globe. Next to the globe is a cone. The bottom image is a box with the word Plane, and an image of a globe. Next to the globe is a square that has been slightly turned and laid down, as if it was on a desk.)
      Cylinder
      Cylinder – Imagine wrapping a giant piece of paper around the Earth, tracing Earth’s features, and then laying the paper flat. Cartographers usually build cylindrical projections as though the cylinder touches the equator. Where the map touches or intersects the globe has the least distortion. As the cartographer, you choose how to wrap Earth to control where the cylinder “touches.”
      (Image has two elements; On the left we see a globe of the Earth, there is a translucent paper wrapped around the globe forming a cylinder. There is a red line at the Equator, this shows where the paper meets the Earth’s surface. On the right we see the map has been unrolled into a “Mercator” map and there is a red line on the equator showing where the least amount of distortion will occur.)
      Cone
      Cone – Imagine placing an ice cream cone of soccer cone over Earth like a hat and tracing the Earth’s features. Cut the cone along one vertical edge and you would create a conical projection. Like other projections, the location on Earth where the cone touches has the least distortion. As the cartographer, you can control where the cone “touches.”
      (Image has two elements; On the left we see a globe of the Earth, there is a translucent cone covering the globe. There is a red line mid-way between the Equator and North Pole. This shows where the cone meets the Earth’s surface. On the right we see the map has been unrolled and there is a red line on the map showing where the least amount of distortion will occur. The red line will curve as it follows a line of longitude, forming half of a ring.)
      Plane
      Plane – Imagine laying a stiff piece against the Earth’s surface and tracing the features. The paper touches Earth at only one point or set of points. Your map will have the least distortion where the paper touches. As the cartographer, you choose how to position your paper map.
    (Image has two elements; On the left we see a globe of the Earth, there is a translucent paper that has been placed horizontally against the globe. The paper has been and pushed through to the other side, similar to a blade cutting a tomato. There is a red line around the globe where the paper has sliced through, and this shows where the paper meets the Earth’s surface. On the right we see the map has been laid out and forms a “Polar” map. There is a red ring mid-way between the Equator and North Pole showing where the least amount of distortion will occur.) </p>

  <h2>Distortion</h2>
  <p>Lesson 3 of 5:</p>
  <p>Look in a mirror. Open your eyes wide. Notice how other parts of your face change, like your forehead wrinkling up. Now smile – notice how your cheeks bulge toward the sides? The point is that when you change one aspect of your face, other parts distort, or change, as well. Cartographers deal with distortion in mapmaking.
    Map distortion is the bending, twisting, or forcing of Earth out of its natural shape. All maps have some distortion in area, shape, direction, or distance because cartographers are attempting to show a round earth on a flat map.
    (Image has two elements; On the left is a map of the earth which appears to have been “peeled” off of a globe. The map is flat now but due to the peeling, appears to have “gaps” between continents which are separated by ocean water. The map appears to have the shape of an “M” but has another leg on the right side. The first leg is made up of only water, the second leg or middle of the “M” has North America at the top, and South America below, to the right. The next portion of the “M”, which has an extra leg shows Africa, Eurasia and Australia. On the right is a picture of a young girl, who’s facial expressions change from a rested state to a smile.)
    This “Interrupted” equal-area projection map looks like the cartographer tried to peel a globe and lay it flat. It is a combination of projections instead to show the continents as they really appear. This projection visually proves that making a perfect flat map of the earth is impossible. </p>

  <h2>Pick your Distortion</h2>
  <p>Lesson 4 of 5:</p>
  <p>Examine this image to Compare the distortions of different map projections (mathematic means and description for representing Earth on a flat surface).
    Notice how the different projections cause different types of distortion. Cartographers have developed hundreds of map projections to improve accuracy. All maps, however, have some distortion of shape, size, distance, and direction. Cartographers choose a projection depending on which of those factors is most important for a particular map.
    (Image of 3 maps titled “Three Map Projections Centered at 39 N and 96W”. The map has 3 outlines of the United States and the state borders, the maps all overlap each other. There is a pin in the center of the image to show that all three maps are centered at this point. The red map is labeled as a “Mercator” and has the least distortion for direction. The blue map is labeled “Lambert Conformal Conic” and has the least amount of distortion of land shape and size. The green map is labeled “Un-Projected Latitude and Longitude” and distorts distances the least.)
    Rollover the hotspot in the image for more information:
    Hot Spot Description:
    Cylindrical projections have the least distortion of direction. Planar Projections distort distance the least. Conic projections have the least distortion of land shape and size. </p>
