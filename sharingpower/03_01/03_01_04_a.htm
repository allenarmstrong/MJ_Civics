<h2>State Government Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Teen:</strong> You can learn a lot about government by hanging out in Washington D.C. but do you know that most of the laws you live by come from your state government? Take a look!</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> America is comprised of 50 states united as one nation. You might think that the laws we live by come from the national government but actually most government comes from the states.</p>

<p>The 10th amendment of the U.S. constitution declares that powers not given to the national government are reserved to the states respectfully. So each state has the power to enact policies and laws not covered by the authority of the national government.</p>

<p>One of these is the power to establish public schools. Each state determines how funds should be distributed to public schools and the courses and classes that should be taught to meet state educational standards.</p>

<p>Another power reserved to the states is determining license requirements for professionals. Such requirements make sure that you will get the best services possible from a doctor, a lawyer, or a teacher.</p>

<p>One of the most important powers is establishing and maintaining state government. Each state has a constitution that explains the way it's government is organized and how power is distributed among it's branches. Just like the national government all states have three branches of government. The executive branch, which enforces the laws, is lead by the governor, the legislative branch makes laws, and the judicial branch makes decisions about the laws.  Just like the national government each branch of state government has powers that can restrain the actions of the other two. This is the system of checks and balances.</p>

<p>Each state constitution also has a declaration of rights, similar to the bill of rights, that protects individual liberties. State governments are very similar in structure to the national government and state government has an enormous influence on our daily lives. States take an active role in promoting the health and welfare of their citizens. Most fund ambitious public health, safety, and welfare programs. These programs immunize children against diseases and provide funds to keep people healthy. The states distribute cash assistance, often called welfare, to those who need it. They regulate public safety by establishing and paying for police and correction systems and they also maintain state highway systems.</p>

<p>Today we enjoy a society that is relatively peaceful and safe. We owe a large part of that to the hard work and foresight of our state governments.</p>

<p><strong>Teen:</strong> Now it's your turn to answer a question. What is one responsibility of state government?</p>
