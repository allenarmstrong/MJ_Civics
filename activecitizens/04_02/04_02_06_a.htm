<h2><em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em> Text Version</h2>
<p><em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em> was decided in 1954 by the United States Supreme Court. In that case, there were a group of parents who had students in the schools, the public schools of Topeka. And they challenged the then-existing law that said separate but equal schools for children of different races was okay.</p>
<p>In the decision of <em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em>, the United States Supreme Court said that separate but equal facilities are inherently unequal. And by this decision, the United States Supreme Court reversed the earlier United States Supreme Court case in <em>Plessy vs. Ferguson</em>. And from this moment on, from the time of the rendering of <em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em>, the law of the land was that segregation was illegal.</p>
