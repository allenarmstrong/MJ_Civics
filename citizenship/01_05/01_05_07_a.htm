<h2>Rules of Citizenship Text Version</h2>
<p>Review the following examples based on a person's place of birth.</p>

<p><strong>Birthplace: Topeka, Kansas</strong>—People born within the states of the United States are native U.S. citizens. They have the &ldquo;law of the soil,&rdquo; or jus soli.</p>
<p><strong>Birthplace: San Juan, Puerto Rico</strong>—People born within many territories of the United States, such as Puerto Rico, are native U.S. citizens. They have the &ldquo;law of the soil,&rdquo; or jus soli.</p>
<p><strong>Birthplace: U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba</strong>—The citizenship of people born on U.S. military bases depends on their parents. If at least one parent is a legal U.S. citizen and has lived in U.S. territory for at least one year before the child&rsquo;s birth, the child is a native U.S. citizen. This situation is jus sanguinis, or &ldquo;law of the blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Birthplace: Montreal, Canada</strong>—The citizenship of people born in foreign countries depends on their parents. If at least one parent is a legal U.S. citizen and has lived in U.S. territory for at least one year before the child&rsquo;s birth, the child is a native U.S. citizen. This situation is jus sanguinis, or &ldquo;law of the blood.&rdquo; Depending on U.S. laws and the laws of the other country, some babies may have dual citizenship. This means that two countries accept them as citizens.</p>
