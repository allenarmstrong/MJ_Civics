<h2>Comic Text Version</h2>
<h3>Scene 1</h3> 
<p>Erik is watching television. Mom is standing nearby.</p>
<p>[Mom] Erik, you have been sitting on the couch and watching far too much television each day. It&rsquo;s time to get up and be active for your health. New rule—no TV until after dinner. Off you go!</p>
<p>[Erik] Aww, mom!</p>
  <h3>Scene 2</h3> 
  <p>Erik is sitting in front of a different TV in his bedroom. His game system appears prominently between him and the TV. He is using it to watch a movie. Mom is standing with hands on hips.</p>
  <p>[Mom] Erik! I said no TV until after dinner!</p>
  <p>[Erik] But mom, technically it&rsquo;s not TV. I&rsquo;m using my game system to watch a <em>movie</em>. </p>
  <p>[Mom] That&rsquo;s the same thing to me! Turn it off!</p>
  <p>[Erik] Geesh, sorry…</p>
  <h3>Scene 3</h3>
   <p>Erik is playing his personal game system (like a Nintendo DS). Mom is angrier now.</p>
   <p>[Mom] Goodness, Erik, what are you doing now?</p>
   <p>[Erik] (innocently) Playing my game?</p>
   <p>[Mom] I said not until after dinner!</p>
   <p>[Erik] But it&rsquo;s a game, not TV…</p>
   <p>[Mom] Turn it off!</p>
   <p>[Erik] (sadly) Okay, let me put it on the charger.</p>
  <h3>Scene 4</h3>
   <p>Erik is on the home computer in the office. Mom looks like she is about to have a coronary.</p>
   <p>[Erik] Mom! Don&rsquo;t freak out, okay? I&rsquo;m working on my homework.</p>
   <p>[Mom] (through gritted teeth) I don&rsquo;t see you typing anything.</p>
   <p>[Erik] It is, though. I&rsquo;m watching a program about the effect of video games on the brain, for science. </p>
   <p>[Mom] (still irritated) Well, dinner&rsquo;s ready. Save your work and let&rsquo;s go.</p>
   <p>[Erik] Okay, doing it now, Mom.</p>
   <p>[Mom] One more thing—let me clarify the rule. From now on, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;No <em>screens</em> until after dinner.&rdquo;
