<h2>Kids Helping Kids Text Version</h2>

<p>[Interviewer] What type of service project are you involved in?</p>
<p>[Arielle] I am involved in a service project called Kids Helping Kids. This is an anti-bullying project whose purpose is to not focus on the victim but the bully, the cause of bullying. </p>
<p>[Interviewer] How does your service impact your community?</p>
<p>[Arielle] It impacts my community because It raises kids' self esteem and prevents further bullying. </p>
<p>[Interviewer] What have you learned as a result of your service?</p>
<p>[Arielle] I learned that one person can actually change the world and if you work hard enough you will achieve. </p>
<p>[Interviewer] What motivates you to be an involved member of your community?</p>
<p>[Arielle] What motivates me is that at one point I was a victim and I was a bully if you will. After seeing it from both sides, you can really tell that it is a problem. And, the fact that I can change it, there is no reason not to. </p>
<p>[Interviewer] What tips would you give to other students who want to make a difference in their own communities?</p>
<p>[Arielle] For someone who wants to make a difference in their own community, I strongly recommend that they organize what they're doing. How much money will they need? Where are you going to get your supplies? Where are you going to use the space? Then after that, just go for it.</p>
