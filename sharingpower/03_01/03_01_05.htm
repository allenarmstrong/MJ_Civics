<h1>What Do Local Governments Do?</h1>
<p>The states have the power to set up local governments. Each state constitution determines how local governments should function in that state. Nearly 40,000 counties, municipalities, and townships exist across the United States. Their services vary according to state laws and the needs and desires of the <span class="tooltip">community<span><strong>Community:</strong> a group of people who live in the same area, have a common background, or share similar interests</span></span>. In general, they arrange law enforcement, waste management, fire protection, local <span class="tooltip">infrastructure<span><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> the basic physical systems of a community's people, including roads, electric power, and water supply</span></span>, and other services important to our daily lives.</p> 
<p>Most often, a group of elected officials heads local governments. A <span class="tooltip">municipality<span><strong>Municipality:</strong> a city, town, or other area that has its own local government</span></span> may have a mayor or city commission chair who leads it.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 <span class="tooltip">special purpose districts<span><strong>Special Purpose Districts:</strong> local government units that organize and monitor a service or set of services separate from the city, county, or other traditional local governments</span></span> exist nationwide as well. Public hospitals, port authorities, and water supply districts are examples of special purpose districts. A special purpose district provides a specific, limited service. They are set up because it may be more <span class="tooltip">efficient<span><strong>Efficient:</strong> well organized and able to achieve goals with a minimum of resources, time, and effort</span></span> to organize a special district across county or city lines. Another reason for this type of district is that it may provide a service that local governments typically do not offer.</p>

<p>The Tampa Port Authority is an example of a special purpose district that oversees facilities making up the largest and busiest port in Florida. Huge cargo ships deliver building materials, fuels, and other goods sold throughout the southern United States. People traveling on cruise ships go in and out of the port daily. The port is as busy as a city by itself! The governing board of the Tampa Port Authority organizes and monitors all the activity of the port.</p>
