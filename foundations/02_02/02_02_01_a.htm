<h2>How Do Your Experiences Influence You? <br /> 
Text Version</h2><br /><br />
<h3>Page 1</h3>
<p>&quot;The book <em>The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane</em> by Kate DiCamillo influenced me to stay close to my parents so I never get separated from them. I would never want to have to find my way back from a place far away from them!" –Anna</p>
<h3>Page 2</h3>
<p>"The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling influenced me in many ways. The author really spoke to me and let me know important messages about friendship by the way the three friends stuck by each other's sides no matter what the danger was. They never gave up on each other or themselves. This book really impacted the way I think about friendship." –Brooke</p>
<h3>Page 3</h3>
<p>"I read the book <em>I'm Deborah Sampson: A Soldier in the War of the Revolution</em> by Patricia Clapp and it influenced me how I think about soldiers and war. This book makes you feel like it is happening to you! It is so heart crushing, and it gets the point across that we need to be thankful for our veterans and their families." –Jaclyn</p>
