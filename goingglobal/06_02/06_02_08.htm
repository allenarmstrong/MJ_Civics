<h1>How Has Geography Influenced North America?</h1>
<p>North America is a land with rich natural resources and varied climates. It has many types of <span class="tooltip">industries<span><strong>Industry:</strong> organized activity related to the production of a specific product or range of products</span></span>. Diverse land and water features have shaped its settlement, economies, and governments.</p>
<p><span class="tooltip">Migration<span><strong>Migration:</strong> movement from one place to another</span></span> to North America is still popular from around the world. Push factors refer to things that make people want to leave their current location. Pull factors refer to things that attract people to a certain location.</p>
<p>Now you should be familiar with a few aspects of geography. Try this activity to learn some specific and important ways geography has affected North America.</p>

In fact, Canada and Mexico both export about 75 percent of their goods and services to the United States alone! They import more than 50 percent of their products from the United States as well. Most U.S. imports come from China, but that is closely followed by its neighbors!</p>

                The answer is all of the above! The cost of trade is less for nearby areas. Countries trade because they have resources and products that others need and want.

Competition between their governments to claim territory was high. To this day, their influence is seen and felt. The United States and Canada have governments heavily based on English traditional laws. The main language spoken in each is English, except for the Canadian province Quebec, where French is the main language. The U.S. state of Louisiana calls its local governments "parishes" from its French background. Most people in Mexico speak Spanish, as do many people in the U.S. Southwest, once part of Mexico. Many Mexican traditions and government policies trace back to Spain. Leaders from these countries who interact often must be very familiar with the others' languages, laws, and cultures.</p>
<p>Question:<br/>
Since U.S. government and laws mostly came from England, why do so many people speak Spanish in the United States?</p> <!-- this line is optional -->

            <p>The Mississippi River attracted many settlers. People even today tend to settle close to areas with water. Near the river is fertile soil for growing crops. Rivers like the Mississippi and St. Lawrence make it easier to move goods for trade. The Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Atlantic Ocean form pathways to Europe and Africa. The mouth of the Mississippi River is still a busy area for shipping and trade. Control of that area was in dispute for many years before the U.S. government established it as territory. Closeness to water also provides other ways to earn a living, such as fishing and oil drilling. Water can create electric power. Water access and the minerals and life within are important resources.</p>
<p>Question:<br/>

            <p>Mountains create challenges for people, businesses, and governments alike! As population spread to the west, the people wanted a way to travel easier between other areas. Different areas of the country wanted to be able to trade with one another. The United States built a great railroad that crossed the Rocky Mountains. It was expensive and dangerous. People who migrated from other countries were offered this dangerous work for low pay. Many accepted because they wanted to live in the growing United States. Canals and highways also improved transportation of goods and people. Mountainous areas have opportunities as well as challenges. Coal, an important fuel source, is mined in the Appalachian Mountains.  Mining for coal and other important resources like diamonds and silver happens in Canada and Mexico, too. Countries' governments establish safety standards for dangerous activities like mining and construction. They also make agreements and laws about accepting workers from other countries on a temporary or permanent basis.</p>

                <input type=radio class="ui_choice" name="choice" value="correct" data-feedback="correct"><label>A.

            <p>A country's absolute and relative location affect climate and industries. The United States crosses many areas of latitude, leading to diverse climates and crop production. Improvements in farming make it possible for most people in North America to do other types of work. Opportunities in Canada and the United States attract immigrants, many from Mexico, which is still developing its industries. Many Mexicans seek the better pay for work offered in the United States to improve their lives. People who want a vacation or a life without snow are attracted to Florida and Mexico for the warmer climates. Alaska, the northernmost and largest U.S. state, is too cold for many Americans. Its population is concentrated in the south. However, Alaska is home to many recreation opportunities, and it has productive fishing, forestry, and oil industries.</p>

<p>Most Canadians live along Canada's southern border with the United States where it is warmest and work opportunities are most available. Forestry is a big industry in Canada. Wood from that country helps support the heavy construction in the United States.</p>
<p>Question:<br/>

            	The answer is D! Work in forestry is most likely to attract an experienced construction worker from Florida. He or she might move to Canada to try a related line of work.

            <p>The borders between countries are important places. Often, they are based on geographic features, such as the Rio Grande River between Texas and Mexico. Countries also lay claim over water, to an extent. Countries may disagree over the claims, especially when a valuable resource like oil is involved.  For example, the United States has disputes with Canada and Mexico over where their control ends over water. The disputes  relate most to control of fishing or oil activities.  The U.S.-Canada border is in dispute, with the line dividing people's property in some places! </p>

<p>Resources lead to businesses, jobs, and income for the people of a country. The industries based on these resources can attract people to other countries.  Increases or decreases in population affect government services, crime, and other aspects of life. People might be desperate to leave a country because of problems there, and other countries feel a responsibility to protect them. For example, some people from Mexico, Cuba, and other areas wish to move to the United States. They hope for opportunities not available at home. Americans disagree whether more people from other countries should be allowed to move to the United States. Luckily, the governments of most of these countries have friendly relationships. Trade between them is very important to protect. They consult each other often to work out these issues.
