<h2>Legislative Choices: Answers Text Version</h2>
<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>Imagine you are a member of the Florida House of Representatives. You receive a few letters of concern about an incident that happened in the district you serve. A very rude text message sent to many students caused disruption in classrooms during school hours. School officials tracked down and punished the students responsible. School district officials and many others wish for a state law to prevent such an event in the future. What do you do?</p>
<ul>
  <li id="s1c1">Choice 1: Ignore the letters and emails. The school district should handle it themselves.<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;The school district officials themselves are some of the people calling for a state law. They contact you because they feel stronger actions are needed to protect students not only in their district but also throughout the state.&rdquo;</li>
  <li id="s1c2"><strong>Choice 2: Introduce a bill to ban use of electronic devices in school.<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;An overwhelming number of people in your district wrote to you expecting you to take action. You agree with them.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>Your bill is written, given a code for reference, and read to the legislature. A council of members is trying to decide which committee should work on the bill. Which committee should consider your bill?</p>
<ul>
  <li id="s2c1"><strong>Choice 1: Education Committee<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;This issue is specific to the use of electronic devices in schools. This is the best committee to handle your bill. Imagine you are on this committee and will continue to work on the bill.&rdquo;</strong></li>
  <li id="s2c2">Choice 2: Criminal and Civil Justice Policy Council<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;School officials punished the students who sent the text. However, this council handles bills related to the court system. The Education Committee is the better choice because the issue is specific to use of electronic devices in schools.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 3</h4>
<p>Imagine you are a member of the Education Committeee. The Education Committee hold a hearing on the bill. Which group of witnesses to the hearing would be most likely to support the bill?</p>
<ul>
  <li id="s3c1">Choice 1: American Civil Liberties Union<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;This group of citizens is concerned about restrictions to people's rights. They may not support the bill unless it is very clear and specific to a safety concern.&rdquo;</li>
  <li id="s3c2"><strong>Choice 2: Florida School Boards Association<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;Since school district officials were some of the original writers to you on the issue, their organization would likely support the bill.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 4</h4>
<p>The Education Committee reads the bill again. Some members of the committee are concerned that your bill is too general to gain support from enough citizens, including some school officials. They want to amend, or change, it to be more specific to what the citizens want. Which change would you support?</p>
<ul>
  <li id="s4c1"><strong>Choice 1: "Use of electronic devices in schools is prohibited, except for devices approved for educational purposes."<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;This amendment to your bill allows teachers to use technology for learning purposes, such as computers and televisions.&rdquo;</strong></li>
  <li id="s4c2">Choice 2: "Use of electronic devices in schools by students is prohibited during school hours."<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;The committee members know that many teachers want their students to be able to use devices like computers and televisions for learning. This amendment is still too general to gain committee support. The other amendment allows teachers to use technology for learning purposes and is the better option.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 5</h4>
<p>A majority of Education Committee members approve the amended bill and sends it to the Rules and Calendar Council. The council places the bill on the calendar for meetings of the entire House. At the scheduled time, the bill is read to the House for the second time, though now it is a bit different. Some representatives still have concerns. Which change would you support this time?</p>
<ul>
  <li id="s5c1"><strong>Choice 1: "Use of electronic devices in school is prohibited, except for devices used by teachers for instruction. Student use of electronic devices may be allowed in situations to be determined by the school district."<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;This amendment gives school officials more flexibility in use of electronic devices. They may wish to allow students, not just teachers, to use cell phones and other devices in certain situations.&rdquo;</strong></li>
  <li id="s5c2">Choice 2: "Use of electronic devices in school is prohibited, except for computers and televisions used by teachers for instruction."<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;The correct answer is Choice 1. This amendment further restricts the use of electronic devices by naming only two types, computers and televisions. It still limits use to teachers, where school officials and teachers may wish to give students more access on their own for learning.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 6</h4>
<p>With the new change, the majority of Florida House members approve the bill. The Florida Senate passed a similar bill, but it was different. The Conference Committee, made up of representatives and senators, meets to rewrite a bill that satisfies the changes made in both the House and Senate. The compromise bill goes to each chamber for a new vote. The Florida Senate has 40 members and the Florida House has 120 members. How many members in each chamber must vote in support of the bill to pass it?</p>
<ul>
  <li id="s6c1">Choice 1: Two-thirds, so at least 27 senators and 80 representatives<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;The correct answer is Choice 2. A simple majority is required in each chamber to pass a bill. However, the two-thirds number could be important later.&rdquo;</li>
  <li id="s6c2"><strong>Choice 2: A majority, so at least 21 senators and 61 representatives<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;A simple majority is required in each chamber to pass a bill. However, the two-thirds number could be important later.&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>Scenario 7</h4>
<p>Your bill passes both the Florida House and Senate. Now the passed bill goes to the governor. What may the governor do?</p>
<ul>
  <li id="s7c1"><strong>Choice 1: Veto the bill<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;Both options are possible. The governor may sign the bill into law. If he or she takes no action, the bill will become law after 15 days. If the governor vetoes the bill, the legislature may overturn the veto if two-thirds of representatives and two-thirds of senators vote for it, just like in the U.S. Congress.&rdquo;</strong></li>
  <li id="s7c2">Choice 2: Sign it into law<br /><br />
  Feedback—&ldquo;Both options are possible. The governor may sign the bill into law. If he or she takes no action, the bill will become law after 15 days. If the governor vetoes the bill, the legislature may overturn the veto if two-thirds of representatives and senators vote for it, just like in the U.S. Congress.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Your bill survived the process! The governor signed it into law. Now it goes to the Secretary of State and will soon take effect. Thanks for your hard work!</p>
