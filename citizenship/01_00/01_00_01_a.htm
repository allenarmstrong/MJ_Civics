<h2>Text Version</h2>
<p>[Interviewer] Introduce yourself.</p>
<p>[Camille] Hi, I'm Camille Manybeads Tso. I'm 15 years old and I'm a Navajo filmmaker.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] Tell us about the film you created.</p>
<p>[Camille] The film I created is called "In the footsteps of the Yellow Woman" and it's a 26 minute docudrama about my great, great, great grandmother and her struggle from 1864 to 1868 with the Navajo long walk.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] What inspired you to make it?</p>
<p>[Camille] In 8th grade I was home schooled by my mom and she gave me a play space media history assignment to go out and interview somebody who I thought was influential to me in my community and just ask him questions about the area—and I chose my grandmother. She told me about Yellow Woman and her struggle.</p>

<p>[Interviewer] Who helped you produce the film?</p>
<p>[Camille] My mom.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] Where did you learn the information you needed to make the film?</p>
<p>[Camille] Just from interviewing my grandmother, I did a lot of research at the local college, NEU; and I went around to different family members, gathered stories from who ever knew them. </p>
<p>[Interviewer] Why is it important to you to have family involvement?</p>
<p>[Camille] Family involvement is a HUGE thing for me, because without my family I would not have been able to make it. The really cool part about the film was, all the people who were involved with the film were decedents of Yellow Woman. So, it was all just having that entire family connection. With people the only reason they stay on a film is either they feel truly connected to it or if they are getting paid for it. But with family … you know it's … you can't … family can't really just leave you in a ditch or anything, they're always there for you and it's really great.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] What kinds of things can people learn about Navajo culture and history from your film?</p>
<p>[Camille] Well I hope you can learn a little bit about it from the time period and about some modern day Navajos. Nobody really understands much about that time area. They only think that back then that natives were only in buck skin and feathers and stuff like that. When really they had families. They weren't in buck skins they were in rug dresses. Which is this wool made dress that's hand woven. And it was just very culturally based back then.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] How has creating the film changed you, your family, and your community?</p>
<p>[Camille] Well, like right now I'm in New York for the first time. And it's just … you know being able to travel has been really important. Me and some of my family and the people that helped on the film have traveled throughout the country and have gone to different places. And some of them … and some of my family who helped on the film has helped represent it in different countries. And it's just gone all over the place, which I think is really nice to see everyone taking a liking to it. And to have a lot of my family be a lot more comfortable. There are some family who never really stepped out of the res or stepped out of their comfort bounds or comfort area and are now traveling and speaking in front of people and becoming role models in their school and community; and I think it's really great.</p>
<p>[Interviewer] Well than you so much for sharing a little bit of your life with us today.</p>
<p>[Camille] Thank you.</p>
