<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>
<p>The rule of law is an important part of our daily lives. Laws at the local, state, and national level affect our behavior in the interest of everyone’s well-being. Children, teens, and adults all must follow the laws.</p>
<p>Imagine a local library asked you and your team to give a presentation on the law to other teens. Your goal is to encourage them to learn about laws and to learn why laws are important. Teens should be aware of specific laws that affect their lives. Your team should encourage more teens to get involved in the community in positive ways without getting into trouble. In this activity, you will create a presentation that your team could share with other teens. Use the <strong>Collaboration Assessment Guide</strong> to form your team and start this activity. </p>
<p><strong>Have you begun your service project yet? One idea for service would be that your team could actually present this information to teens. Contact your instructor about this and other ideas for the service project.</strong></p>
<h3>Step 1—Research Laws</h3>
<p>Conduct research to find laws that have an effect on teens' lives. Your team will need to find at least two laws for each member of the team. Therefore, if your team has four members, your presentation should include at least eight laws.</p>
<p>The laws can be any type and can be from different levels of government. For example, perhaps you find a local curfew law interesting and want to cover it as well as federal laws regarding working teens. You can learn about laws through government websites and asking trusted adults. With your parent’s permission, you might ask law enforcement officers, local officials, or a librarian for information.</p>
<h3>Step 2—Discuss the Laws</h3>
<p>In your team, discuss the information you learned about laws. Use the <strong>Team Discussion Template</strong> to guide your discussion.</p>
<h3>Step 3—Plan and Create the Presentation</h3>
<p>Make it fun! Your team can choose the format and images. Perhaps you will make a video of your team members acting out laws. Your team could create a slideshow presentation, a comic strip, or even a song. You can include funny stories to make your presentation more interesting. No matter what format your team chooses, the presentation must include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The importance of laws</li>
  <li>Laws that affect teens (at least two for each team member)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>What the law is and its purpose</li>
    <li>How the law affects teens</li>
    <li>For each law, an image or description of an image that represents someone following the law</li>
    <li>For each law, an image or description of an image that represents someone not following the law</li>
  </ul>
  <li>How teens can affect their communities in positive ways</li>
  <li>Bibliography for sources of information</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4—Share and Discuss Your Presentation</h3>
<p>As a team, share and discuss the draft of your Laws and Teens Presentation. Share it with trusted adults to get their input and ideas. They may be able to point out issues your team did not consider. The questions below will help your team analyze your plan. Be sure to discuss any changes with your team before editing the document.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does your team explain the purpose for laws in a way teens will understand?</li>
  <li>Does your team have at least two examples of laws per team member?</li>
  <li>Does your team have an image or image description showing each law being followed?</li>
  <li>Does your team have an image or image description showing each law not being followed?</li>
  <li>Does your team explain how teens can affect their communities in positive ways?</li>
  <li>Does your team describe who has authority and how they get their positions?</li>
  <li>Does your team include all the sources of your information?</li>
</ul>
