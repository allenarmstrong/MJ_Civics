<h2>How Is Currency Exchanged?</h2>
<p>This is the stock exchange in Wall Street New York city. Billions of dollars worth of stock are bought from here every day.The decisions made here on a daily basis affect almost everyone in the world. This is Galgenberg, a town in New South Wales, Australia. It's not quite the farthest point you can get from New York city, but it's pretty close. And that's just fine for farmer, Rob Wass. "I farm with my father and my brother. We are into wool production and replacement hurds, we are also into cropping and cattle production."</p>
<p>Even though New York is 16,000 km away, what happens there has a very real impact on Rob. The main reason is that the grain he grows is bought and sold in U.S. dollars. And the value of the Australian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar is largely determined at the Wall Street stock exchange.</p>
<p>A one cent movement of the Austrailan dollar upwards lowers the value of wheat by six dollars a ton. In a good year, Rob will grow 5,000 tons of wheat. So, for each cent the Australian dollar goes up against the greenback, Rob is losing 30,000 dollars. The same implies in reverse. If the Australian dollar falls against the greenback, Rob gains 30,000 dollars for each cent the dollar depreciates.</p>
<p>The Australian dollor, like the U.S. and Canadian dollars, the Euro and the Pound Sterling, is a floating currency. This means that the value of these currencies is determined by market forces, supply and demand, rather than governments.</p>
<p>Currency speculators are people or institutions that buy a particular currency and hope that its value will rise, when they can sell it for a profit. For example, if you buy one Euro when it is worth one U.S. dollar and sell it a year later when it's worth a dollar and ten cents, you can make ten percent profit. It's only ten cents when your dealing with one dollar, but major banks and corporations are dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars. It's estimated that currency speculators account for ninety-eight percent of foreign exchange transactions. And remember, when currency goes up or down, it has a huge impact on farmers like Rob.</p>
