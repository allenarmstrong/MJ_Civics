<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>
<p>Collaboration is an important part in making public policy. The people and their lawmakers can share ideas about new laws or programs before they become law or public policy. Laws are more effective and have greater support when the people can help define and choose them.</p>
<p>Imagine you and your partners work as part of a special citizen group seeking to have an impact on government. Your team’s task is to choose an issue and debate several public policy idea alternatives to help solve the issue. Your team will agree on the best public policy alternative and will make the recommendation to a related lawmaking group or government agency. </p>
<h3>Step 1—Identify the Citizen Group Issue</h3>
<p>All members of your team should have an issue they researched from the lesson. Therefore, if your team has four members, you should have four issues to discuss. Members should share with the team what they have learned about their issues. Note that some team members may have chosen local issues while others have state-level issues. If team members have the same issue, the team should compare the information they found. They should discuss how the issue might vary from one community to another. From your discussion, your team needs to agree on one issue to study in more detail as a team. </p>
<p>You may use the discussion area or a Web 2.0 Tool to organize your team’s work. Be sure you have parent and instructor permission before using websites or communicating outside the course. The first section of the <strong>Collaboration Assessment Guide</strong> will help you organize your team.</p>
<h3>Step 2—Conduct Background Research</h3>
<p>The team member who suggested the issue may have given the team great information. The team should use this information as a starting point to learn more. Is the issue a local or a state issue? If it is a local issue, is it an issue for your community and the communities of other team members? </p>
<p>Your team should answer the following questions whether you choose a state or a local issue. What government agencies address the issue? What citizen groups exist in your team’s communities that have an interest in the issue? Can your team find any policies or laws in your local areas or state that address the issue? Can you find current news items in your team’s communities that discuss the issue?</p>
<h3>Step 3—Determine the Solution and Identify Your Citizen Group Criteria</h3>
<p>In your team, determine a solution for the issue that would work for the area or areas where the problem exists. Then brainstorm the criteria you will use to judge each public policy alternative for the issue your team has chosen to address. Basic criteria include being low in cost, easy to carry out, and supported by the community. Each team member may have additional criteria specific to the chosen issue. Your team should agree on the criteria. Make sure the criteria are appropriate to the level of government related to your issue. </p>
<h3>Step 4—Identify and Evaluate Public Policy Alternatives</h3>
<p>Now your team should discuss all public policy alternatives for the issue. Team members should identify ideas in addition to those the individual team member suggests. Compare each public policy alternative to the criteria. Use the<strong> Citizen Group Debate Chart</strong> to organize your discussion.</p>
<h3>Step 5—Submit to Instructor</h3>
<p>There are <strong>two parts</strong> to your work in this collaboration activity. View the Grading Rubrics before completing and submitting this activity. </p>
