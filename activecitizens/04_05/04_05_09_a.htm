<h2>Case Decision Template</h2>
<p><strong>Your Name: ______________________________</strong>
<h3>Case A</h3>
<p>The drama class at a middle school was preparing for their spring play in the school auditorium. One week before the performance, a parent complained to the school board that the play was inappropriate for middle school students. The school board agreed and contacted the principal, who then informed the classes that the show was canceled. Students were upset that their preparations were a waste. They believe they have the right to freedom of expression in performing the play. The school board said that students are minors and that it must approve decisions about what is presented in school by teachers or students. The students did not have time to plan a different show. A group of the students&rsquo; parents brought the case to court on their behalf, but lost the case in state district court. The students&rsquo; parents appealed the district court&rsquo;s decision to their state court of appeals. There the students and their parents won the case, but the school board appealed the decision to their state-level supreme court. The state supreme court ruled in favor of the school board. Unhappy with the state supreme court&rsquo;s decision, the students&rsquo; parents are now appealing the to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Case B</h3>
<p>Two middle school students often wear clothing with slogans like &ldquo;Vegan All Day, Every Day, &ldquo;The Moo Moo is a No No,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Be Cool, Be Vegan.&rdquo; The students believe that consuming any animal products, like meat and milk, is bad for health and bad for the environment. They began a campaign to convince all the students in the school to bring lunch from home instead of eating school lunch. Each day greater numbers of students brought their lunch to school and wore pro-vegan clothing. The school suspended the students who began the campaign against the school lunches. School officials said it was a disruption to the school because food was wasted and cafeteria workers had less to do. The students&rsquo; parents complained, saying their students have the right to express their ideas and opinions through their clothing and actions. They brought the case to court on the students&rsquo; behalf. The students&rsquo; parents lost the case in state district court and so appealed it to their state court of appeals. There they won the case, but the school board appealed the decision to their state-level supreme court. The state supreme court found in favor of the school board. The students and their parents are now appealing the state supreme court&rsquo;s decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
