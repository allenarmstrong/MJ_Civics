<h3>Was Amy's Privacy Violated?</h3>
<p>The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution protects people from searches without a strong reason to suspect wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Amy is the wife of a soldier but not in the military herself. She was stopped by police while shopping at the mall and all her belongings searched. They let her go, finding no stolen goods. Amy was embarrassed and believes her rights were violated by the search. The officer says the law allows him to search anyone who looks suspicious. Amy wants to challenge this law in court.</p>
<p>What is the type of law related to this situation?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li><strong>Constitutional</strong></li>
  <li>Criminal</li>
  <li>Civil</li>
  <li>Military</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> Though Amy is a soldier's wife, she is not in the military herself, so military law does not apply in this situation. Since she believes her rights under the Constitution were wrongly taken away, it is a question of constitutional law.</p>
                
<h3>Was Amy's Privacy Violated?</h3>
<p>Amy was stopped by police while shopping and all her belongings searched. They let her go, finding no stolen goods.  Amy was embarrassed. She believes her rights were violated by the search. The officer says the law allows him to search anyone who looks suspicious. Amy wants to challenge this law in court. <br/><br/>What is the source of law related to this situation?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Statute</li>
  <li>Regulation</li>
  <li><strong>Case Law</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong> The officer says the search was done because of a law, or statute. However, since Amy is challenging the law itself as a violation of her rights, the courts will use case law, or prior decisions of courts, to determine if in fact the law unfairly takes away people's rights.</p>
