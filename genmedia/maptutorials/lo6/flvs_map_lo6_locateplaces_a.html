<p><em>Image two young adults; a male and a female.</em></p>
<p>Male: I live in Washington, D.C. just west of the Chesapeake Bay and North of Florida.</p>
<p>Female: Washington, D.C. is at 38 degrees, 53 minutes north latitude, and 77 degrees, 2 minutes west longitude.</p>

<p>Lesson 2 of 6:</p>
<p><em>Image that shows the back of a car on a road.</em></p>
<p>We’re going south, so … we could take I-95, get off of the ISB exit, I think there are two of them though, … and I’m not sure if it’s Route 92 or 90 … hmm. If we take U.S. 1, then it would be a right on ISB at the gas station, and, um … probably three miles or so on the left, can’t miss it. It’s not far past the airport.</p>
<p>You seem unsure. My GPS will use latitude and longitude coordinates for where we are now and the Daytona International Speedway to give us exact directions.</p>
<p>In conversation, we usually use relative location. However, when giving directions, modern technology can help drivers avoid error by using absolute location.</p>

<p>Lesson 3 of 6:</p>
<p><em>Image of a section of a map, showing the state of California, with the following cities (from north to south): Crescent City, Sacramento, San Francisco, Fresno, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, San Diego.</em></p>
<p>A scale is a tool that allows you to estimate distance on a map. A scale may be measured using inches and miles, or using the metric system, which uses centimeters and kilometers.</p>
<p>On this map, one inch equals 150 miles. Use your eyes and finger to estimate how many inches are between Los Angeles, California, and the state capital, Sacramento. Then, once you know the distance in inches, multiply that number by 150 to determine the number of miles.</p>
