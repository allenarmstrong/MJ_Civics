<h2>Electoral College FAQ</h2>
<h3>How many electors are there?</h3>
<p>There are a total of 538 electors, so 270 votes would constitute a majority. Each state has a number of electors equal to its number of senators and representatives. Washington, D.C. has three electors, as well. For example, in the 2012 election California will have 55 electoral votes and Alaska will have three.</p>
<h3>Who serves as electors?</h3>
<p>Electors are often people who are being rewarded for service to their political party. They can be elected state or party officials. However, they cannot hold a position in the federal government, such as US Senator.</p>

<h3>How are the electors from Maine and Nebraska unique?</h3>
<p>Almost all states use a “winner-take-all” approach where one set of candidates (president and vice president) receive all electoral votes from the state. Maine and Nebraska are the two exceptions to this rule. Both of these states use the Congressional District Method in which one electoral vote goes to the winner of each district and the remaining electoral votes go to the statewide winner. Prior to 2008, neither state had ever divided its votes. In the 2008 election, Nebraska was split with one electoral vote going to Barack Obama and the other four going to John McCain.</p>
<h3>Why don’t we just use the popular vote to determine the president?</h3>
<p>This system of electing the president is outlined in Article II of the United States Constitution. In order to use a different method to select the president and vice president, an amendment would have to be added to the Constitution.</p>
<h3>Do the electors have to vote for the person who received the most popular votes from the citizens of the state?</h3>
<p>The electors do usually vote according to the popular vote, but they are not required to do so by federal law. State law may direct that the electors vote according to the state popular vote. Political parties may also require that electors pledge to vote for their specific candidate. Some electors have voted contrary to the state’s popular vote in the past, but none have ever been the deciding factor in an election.</p>
<h3>What if none of the candidates receive a majority of the electoral votes?</h3>
<p>The president would be decided by the House of Representatives. Each state would receive one vote, which could be cast for any one of the top three candidates.</p>
