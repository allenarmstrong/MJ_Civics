<h2>Take My Case Text Version</h2>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>My neighbor tells me daily that I am a menace to society because of the way I style my hair. She drives me crazy, and I want to put her in jail. Will you help me punish her?</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>1, 4, 8</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>I wrote a letter to the local news about security at the local park. My friends and I like to hang out there. Whenever kids gang up on each other, no one is there to stop it! The police took me to jail for complaining about park security. I have a right to complain!</p><br /><br />
<p>Oops! The client does have a right to respectfully complain or bring attention to problems. The client cannot go to jail for writing a letter.</p>
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>1, 4, 6</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>My family likes to go hunting during deer season. When my great aunt tried to purchase a new gun, the clerk said she would have to run a criminal history check first. She is not a criminal. She shouldn't have to wait for the background check!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>2, 3, 4</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>Raccoons are constantly turning over our trash bins! My dad wanted to buy a gun to scare them off, but the store clerk said only police officers could purchase them because of a local law. My dad should be able to scare off wild critters!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>1, 2, 5</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>Six U.S. military officers came to our house and said they would have to stay with us a while. It's crowded, and they eat all the cheese puffs! My family should not have to feed and shelter them.</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>3, 4, 8</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>My uncle is a soldier and he stayed with us for a week while on leave. I had to give up my bedroom for him and slept on the couch! My parents say he is welcome anytime. It's not fair!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>1, 3, 10</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>Last night the police came to our house and said a neighbor complained about noise. They looked around the house and took everything that made noise without our consentâ€”TV, stereos, computer, even the dog! This seems wrong. Our town has no rules about noise!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>3, 4, 6</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>My teacher took away my MP3 player! I was jamming away while doing my work. He said I was distracting the class and that the school banned these devices. He can't do that. It's my property!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>2, 4, 7</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>Two months ago at trial, a jury declared me not guilty of robbing the video game store. The court sent me a new trial notice, saying there is new evidence that I may be guilty. It doesn't make sense!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>2, 5, 7</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>I saw a student fall down the stairs and break a leg. The stairwell was crowded during the fire drill. The nurse keeps asking me to tell what I saw happen. I don't have to talk. I know my rights!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>1, 5, 7</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>I have a trial coming up, and my lawyer asked the judge for an extension! She said it would help us gather more witnesses and evidence. I am just so tired of waiting and I want a new lawyer!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>4, 6, 7</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>The judge said that my lawyer would not be able to question the witnesses in front of the jury. How will they hear the evidence? How will they hear my side of the story? This is not fair.</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>1, 5, 6</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>My ex-friend said he plans to take me to court for accidently breaking his $300 game system. He wants to go on one of those judge reality shows. I want a jury to decide the case, not just one person.</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>2, 5, 7</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>My sister forgot to put away the ice cream. It melted everywhere, and my mom made me help clean it up! She would not buy more ice cream, either. I want to take them both to court because now I have no ice cream to eat!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>6, 7, 9</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>A mall cop stopped me for skateboarding in the mall. He said he would break my skateboard and ban me from ever skateboarding again. I don't think he can do that.</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>1, 8, 10</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>My parents grounded me for a week for failing my test! They said I should use the time to study and retake the test. This punishment is too harsh!</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>3, 8, 9</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>The Constitution does not say everyone has to go to school. I don't think I should have to go anymore. My principal said I would be in trouble if I don't show up. She can't punish me.</p><br /><br />
<h4>Which amendment relates to the case?</h4>
<p>1, 8, 10</p>
<p>Yes! The 10th Amendment protects state governments' and the peoples' ability to use powers the national government does not have. One example is creating an education system and requiring student attendance.</p>
<h3>Client Situation</h3>
<p>We want to build a new skate park in our city. We already have approval from the local and state governments. Our senator said we couldn't build it without special approval from Congress. That's not necessary!</p><br /><br />
