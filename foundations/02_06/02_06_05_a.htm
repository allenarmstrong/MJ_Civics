<h2>Override Text Version</h2>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Imagine Congress passes a bill the president strongly opposes. Congress sends the president the bill to sign into law.</p>
<p>Instead of signing the law, the president vetoes the bill. The president sends a message to Congress with the veto notice.</p>
<p>Congress can choose to vote again to try to override the veto. If two-thirds of both the House and Senate vote in support of the bill, it becomes law.</p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>A member of the Supreme Court retires. The president must nominate someone to replace the justice. The president announces his nomination to Congress and the public.</p>
<p>The Senate holds a hearing where they interview the nominee. Members of the Senate want to make sure the person is a good fit for such an important position. They can choose to confirm or reject the president's nominee.</p> 
<p>If they confirm the nominee, the new justice will sit on the Supreme Court for life or until retirement.</p> 
<h3>Example 3</h3>
<p>Members of Congress accuse the president of abusing his powers. One member of the House of Representatives suggests they should impeach the president.</p>
<p>Congress may impeach a federal official for serious wrongdoing. In this situation, the House will vote whether to impeach. If they approve it, the Senate will hold the impeachment trial. The chief justice of the Supreme Court oversees the trial. Only if the Senate finds the person guilty at trial will he or she lose the job.</p> 
<h3>Example 4</h3>
<p>Several people are found guilty of violating a law they think is unfair. They come together with a lawyer to challenge the law in court. The case goes to the Supreme Court.</p> 
<p>The Supreme Court can only act on cases that the states and people bring to it. Therefore, a law can exist unless someone challenges it in court and it is found to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court agrees with the people and declares the law unconstitutional. The president no longer enforces the law.</p>
<h3>Example 5</h3>
<p>The president signs a treaty with the president of another country. The Senate must approve the treaty before the United States can officially agree to its terms.</p> 
<p>After the Senate approves the treaty, the president then requests money from Congress to carry it out. All spending bills start in the House of Representatives. Both the House and Senate must approve the bill before the president may spend the money. If either does not approve the amount, the president will have to adjust the spending plan and make a new request.</p>
