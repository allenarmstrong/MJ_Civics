<h2>Documents Review</h2>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Read the quotes from each document carefully. Answer the questions that follow.</p>
<h3>From &ldquo;Common Sense,&rdquo; 1776</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>&ldquo;IN the following pages I offer nothing more than simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;To be always running three or four thousand miles with a tale or a petition, waiting four or five months for an answer, which when obtained requires five or six more [months] to explain it in, will in a few years be looked upon as folly and childishness—There was a time when it was proper, and there is a proper time for it to cease … England [belongs] to Europe, America to itself.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;Europe, and not England, is the parent country of America. This new World hath been the asylum for the persecuted lovers of civil and religious liberty from EVERY PART of Europe.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>&ldquo;I challenge the warmest advocate for reconciliation to show a single advantage that this continent can reap by being connected with Great Britain. … Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe,&rdquo;</li>
