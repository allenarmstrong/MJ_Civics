<h1>How Do Local Governments Make Laws?</h1>
<p>The United States contains thousands of local governments. Each state constitution determines how they are organized and operated within that state. Most states have counties. Cities, towns, townships, school districts, and other divisions can exist within and across counties. An elected council usually runs each type of local government and makes policies and laws. Local governments usually call the laws they make "codes" or "ordinances." Local government meetings are open to the public. They will have public meetings to discuss proposed changes to laws and policies, giving citizens the opportunity to express their views.</p>

<p>For example, Volusia County, Florida, has a county council/manager form of government. The council has seven members, each elected by voters from one of seven districts within the county. The council votes on policies with citizen input. The council hires a county manager to put the policies into effect and manage day-to-day operations of the county government. The county manager is responsible for applying the decisions of the city council.</p> 
<p>Local governments organize school districts to make public policies for local schools. In Florida, each county is also a school district, so there is a School District of Volusia County. A school board consisting of elected members makes public policy concerning education in the county.</p>
