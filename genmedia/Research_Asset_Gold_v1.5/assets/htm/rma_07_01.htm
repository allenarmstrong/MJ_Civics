  <p class="text"><strong>Urban Legend</strong></p>
  <p class="text">Hi! I just read this. Really scary stuff. Please forward to anyone you know who travels!</p>
  <p class="text">TRAVELERS BEWARE!!!</p>
  <p class="text">Law enforcement agencies in major cities throughout the United States are scrambling to protect thousands of people who have had their identities stolen. The culprits: hotel employees.  </p>
  <p class="text">Room keys are digital cards that contain frightening amounts of your personal information, including:</p>
  
  <div class="notes">    
  <ul class="text">
    <li>Your FULL name</li>
    <li>Your home address</li>
    <li>Your phone number</li>
    <li>Your family members’ names</li>
	<li>Your credit card and banking information</li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
  
  
  <p class="text">When you turn in your key card after a nice vacation, you are actually handing over your most personal information to the people behind the desk. These are part-time employees who are difficult to trace, and they can walk out with your card at any time, stealing your identity.   </p>
  <p class="text">If you have visited a hotel with an electronic key card, check your bank account! Change your passwords! Do everything in your power to protect your livelihood. In the future, NEVER return the key cards to the hotel desk. It isn’t worth it!</p>
  <p class="text">Identify the best option to the following questions. </p>
