  <h2>How do Cartographers Structure Maps?</h2>
  <p>Lesson 1 of 8:</p>
  <p> View this slide show to see how cartographers structure maps.</p>
  <p><br />
  Screen 1 of 13:</p>
  <p><em>Image of rotating globe, moving west to east. Earth is shown with its axis labeled along with the North Pole and South Pole.</em></p>
<p> Earth rotates along its axis with the North and South poles marking the ends of the axis. You can see that Earth tilts along this axis as well.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 2 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of rotating globe, moving west to east. Earth is shown with the sun shining from the left.</em></p>
<p>Because of the Earth's rotation, the sun appears to move from east to west in the sky. These directions and points on the globe are the basis for how cartographers set up the maps that they make.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 3 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation.</em></p>
<p>Creating a world map requires showing a curved surface on a flat one. They further divide Earth into sections, measured in degrees.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 4 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation with horizontal lines running through it. A tomato appears at the top-right corner of the map with horizontal lines running through it as well.</em></p>
<p>If you cut a tomato into slices for a sandwich, you can see the sections cartographers make of Earth, called latitude.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 5 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation with horizontal and vertical lines, forming a grid. An orange appears at the top-right corner of the map with vertical lines running through it as well.</em></p>
<p>Cutting an orange into equal sections resembles Earth's lines of longitude. Lines of latitude never touch each other, but lines of longitude come together at the poles.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 6 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation with horizontal and vertical lines. The word &quot;Parallels&quot; appears on the left side of the map.</em></p>
<p>Lines of latitude, also called parallels, circle Earth in rings between the North and South poles.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 7 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation divided by a horizontal line labeled as &quot;Equator&quot; at 0&deg;. The map is divided in two, with the labels &quot;Northen Hemisphere&quot; and &quot;Southern Hemisphere&quot; indicating each section.</em></p>
<p>The equator is the parallel at the widest, most central point around Earth. We label it zero degrees. The equator divides Earth into the northern and southern hemispheres.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 8 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation divided by a horizontal line labeled as &quot;Equator&quot; at 0&deg;. Two lines extend vertically to 90&deg; until they reach the North Pole and South Pole respectively. A message displays on the map saying, &quot;Notice how most of Earth's land is located north of the equator.&quot;</em></p>
<p>As you move north of the equator, the degrees increase until you reach 90 degrees north at the North Pole. The same happens as you move south.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 9 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation divided by a horizontal line 23.5 degrees north of the equator (labeled &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;) and by another horizontal line 23.5 degrees south of the equator (labeled &quot;Tropic of Capricorn&quot;). A message displays on the map saying, &quot;The Tropic of Capricorn marks the parallel spot in the southern hemisphere.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Tropic of Cancer is the line of latitude at approximately 23.5 degrees north. It marks the northernmost point on Earth where you can see the sun directly overhead on the first day of summer.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 10 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation divided by horizontal latitude lines and vertical longitude lines; the vertical lines are labeled &quot;Meridians.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Longitude lines, also called meridians, run from north to south, measuring in degrees.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 11 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation with a vertical line placed at 0&deg;, labeled &quot;Prime Meridian,&quot; dividing the map into two sections, labeled &quot;Western Hemisphere&quot; and &quot;Eastern Hemisphere&quot; respectively. A message displays on the map saying, &quot;The Prime Meridian divides Earth into eastern and western hemispheres.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Cartographers chose the Prime Meridian, running through Greenwich, England, to mark the line of longitude that would measure zero degrees.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 12 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation with a vertical line placed at 0&deg;, labeled &quot;Prime Meridian,&quot; dividing the map into two sections. Two horizontal lines appear at both sides of the Prime Meridian, labeled &quot;West&quot; and &quot;East&quot; respectively, extending to 180&deg;.</em></p>
<p>We measure lines of longitude to the east of the Prime Meridian in degrees east, and those to the west in degrees west. Halfway around the world is the line of longitude 180 degrees.</p>
<br />

<p>Screen 13 of 13:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation with lines of latitude and longitude creating a grid on the map; the values on each axis go up by 10&deg;. The sections of the map are labeled &quot;North,&quot; &quot;South,&quot; &quot;East,&quot; and &quot;West.&quot; A message displays on the map saying, &quot;For example, this point is on the continent of Africa, in the nation of Egypt. Can you determine the degree measure for this point?&quot; A yellow dot flashes on the map, and when you roll over it, a message displays the following text: &quot;It is 30 degrees north latitude, 30 degrees east longitude. We would say the coordinate for this point in Egypt is <strong>30 degrees north, 30 degrees east.</strong> We call specific coordinates &quot;<strong>absolute location</strong>,&quot; which is a latitude and longitude coordinate for a specific point on Earth.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When the lines of latitude and longitude appear together on a globe or map, you can use this grid to identify specific places on Earth.</p>

  <h2>Focus on Compass Directions</h2>
  <p>Lesson 2 of 8:</p>
  <p>Examine this image to study the compass directions more as they relate to <strong>latitude</strong>, which is the angular distance on Earth’s surface, measured north or south in degrees from the Equator, and <strong>longitude</strong>, which is the angular distance on Earth’s surface, measured east or west in degrees from the Prime Meridian.</p>
  <p>Screen 1 of 4:</p>
<p><em>Image of Earth in two-dimensional representation with a vertical line and horizontal line dividing the map into four equal parts. A circle with the letter <b>"A"</b> is placed in the upper-left section over North America, the letter <b>"B"</b> is placed in the upper-right section over Asia, the letter <b>"C"</b> is placed in the lower-left section over South America, and the letter <b>"D"</b> is placed in the lower-right section over Oceania.</em></p>

  <h2>Grid System</h2>
  <p>Lesson 3 of 8:</p>
  <p>Cartographers use lines of latitude and longitude to make precise maps. Electronic navigation systems use <strong>absolute location</strong>, which is a latitude and longitude coordinate for a specific point on Earth, to guide drivers to their destination. Lines of longitude were the main basis for creating Earth's time zones.</p>
  <p>Maps focusing on a small area, like a city, may instead show a <strong>grid system</strong>, which is a map feature that divides areas on the map into sections labeled with letters and numbers, based on smaller distances to allow for easy locating of important spots, like schools or parks. These grids usually use a simple letter and number combination. If you have ever played the game Battleship, you have seen these grids in action. Can you find the school located in section B5 of this map?</p>
<p><em>Image of a street map. Vertical lines (labeled on the left side, &quot;A&quot; to &quot;D&quot;) and horizontal lines (labeled at the top, &quot;1&quot; to &quot;5&quot;) form a grid and divide the map into twenty equally-sized blocks. &quot;Hope Park&quot; is located at point C1, which is three squares down and one square to the right. &quot;Commerce&quot; is located in the middle of points B2 and B3, which are located two squares down and two squares to the right, and two squares down and three squares to the right respectively. &quot;Pine Lakes Middle&quot; is located at point B5, which is two squares down and five squares to the right.</em></p>

  <h2>Precision in Measurement</h2>
  <p>Lesson  4 of 8:</p>
  <p>    Technology today allows cartographers, drivers, and others to map very specific locations, like your house. Large areas of land, even whole nations, sit between lines of latitude and longitute, so degrees break down further into minutes, and then seconds. You can find very precise coordinates for an address.</p>
  <p>For example, the precise coordinates for the White House are written as 38&deg; 53' 51.61&quot; N, 77&deg; 2' 11.58&quot; W. You would say, &quot;The White House coordinates are 38 degrees, 53 minutes, 51. 61 seconds north latitude and 77 degrees, 2 minutes, 11.58 seconds west longitude.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Image of a map application on a mobile phone displaying the location of The White House in relation to latitude and longitude.</em></p>

  <h2>Orientation</h2>
  <p>Lesson 5 of 8:</p>
  <p> The sun's position in relation to Earth determines compass directions. Remember that on Earth's surface &quot;up&quot; is the sky, not &quot;north.&quot; If you are lost and do not have a compass, you can use the sun to find your direction. Remember, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. </p>
  <p>A <strong>map's orientation</strong> is the relationship between directions on the map and the compass directions north, south, east, and west. Examine maps A, B, and C for differences in orientation.</p>
<p>Screen 1 of 3: &quot;Map A&quot;</p>
Traditional maps are oriented so that north points to the top of the map, like this map.</p>
<p><em>Image of a map of the world with a compass, labeled &quot;N,&quot; pointing up. All of the continents are labeled.</em></p>
<br />

<p>Screen 2 of 3: &quot;Map B&quot;</p>
<p>This map appears to be &quot;upside down&quot; though all it does is orient the map with south at the top of the map.</p>
<p><em>Image of the world having North America in the lower half of the map, close to the bottom edge, while Australia is closer to the top edge. A compass, labeled &quot;S,&quot; is pointing up and all of the continents are labeled.</em></p>
<br />

<p>Screen 3 of 3: &quot;Map C&quot;</p>
<p>This map is oriented with the west at the top. Tracing your finger vertically down the map would be moving east.</p>
<p><em>Image of a map of Florida with a compass, labeled &quot;W,&quot; pointing up. The state is labeled &quot;Florida.&quot;</em></p>

<div id="les6" class="slide">
  <h2>Orientation</h2>
  <p>Lesson  6 of 8:</p>
  <p>  Maps A, B, and C all appeared as though you are looking down on Earth. Adding to a cartographer's range of skills is the ability to change the viewing location. Examine Map D.</p>
  <p>&quot;Map D&quot;<br />
This map could be oriented from any compass direction, but notice it appears as though you are viewing the mapped area from a level spot nearby, rather than from the sky.</p>
<p><em>Image of a three-dimensional map of a city with a compass, labeled &quot;N,&quot; pointing up.</em></p>

</div>
<div id="les7" class="slide">
  <h2>Choosing Orientation</h2>
  <p>Lesson 7 of 8:</p>
  <p>    How a cartographer orients a map and its viewing position depends on the map's purpose. For example, a cartographer mapping a theme park will typically orient the map from the point of entry. In other words, the park entrance appears at the bottom of the map, regardless of compass direction. This allows visitors to easily enter and follow turns that match the map in their hands. Well, until they need to turn around, anyway.</p>
  <p>The same problem of orientation when moving in a different direction applies to road maps. Today's technology removes this problem by giving people access to customized directions by start point, or origin, and end point, or destination.</p>
