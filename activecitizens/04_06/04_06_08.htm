<h1>How Did the People and Media Influence the Nixon Case?</h1>

<p>Active Citizens have a right to monitor government leaders. Reporters for the <em>Washington Post</em> found evidence that White House staff members had helped plan and cover up involvement in the break-in. If the reporters had not done their own research, the public may never have known about the connection between the break-in and Nixon's campaign. Congress may never have ordered the investigation.</p>
<p>Many Americans learned about the events through the media. They were shocked that their president could have been involved in criminal activity. They demanded to know the truth about what Nixon knew about the break-in and when he knew it. Many felt he installed the recording system to try to protect him from blame.</p>
<p>Public and media pressure led to the investigator's request that a judge order Nixon to turn over the tapes. Many Americans, including members of Congress, believed Nixon knew something about the break-in. They no longer supported him. Some thought his lack of cooperation on the recordings showed guilt. Nixon felt that Congress might no longer support any decisions he may need to make as president. Therefore, he resigned before the end of his term. Watch this video of his final words as president to the American people.</p>
