<h3>Website 1: David Democrat</h3>
<p>If you want the BEST candidate for mayor of Concord City, be sure to vote for David Democrat. David knows that the future of Concord City is in the hands of its children. His years serving the school board give him a unique insight into Concord City&rsquo;s youth education. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to do more to prepare our students for the 21st century. Our orchards and farms need new ideas, new minds, and new life. A school that focuses on our foundation industry is just what the city needs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>As mayor, David will help bring a new agricultural and technical high school to the city&rsquo;s unused land. Students will get a first-rate education. David also plans to use city funds to give emergency relief to farmers suffering from the drought. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to look at both short-term needs, like the drought, as well as long-term needs, like education.&rdquo; </p>
<p>David believes the city government, and especially the mayor&rsquo;s office, is the best place to plan and manage the goals of Concord City.</p>

<h3>Website 2: Elaine Environs</h3>
<p>If you want a healthy future for Concord City, be sure to vote for Elaine on Election Day. As a teacher, she has spent years studying farming techniques and experimenting with different methods to improve grape production in Concord City. Students in her high school agriculture class maintain a small grape orchard for research. As mayor, Elaine would be able to direct city funds to helping local farmers begin using the improved methods. She could expand research beyond the school into unused city lands from which all residents could benefit. The Green Party supports her research and her candidacy for mayor. She has been a valued member of the party for many years. Elaine knows what farmers need to change to sustain their grape crops for many years. A few Concord City farmers are using her new methods, such as growing vines more thickly to protect against moisture loss. They are pleased with the quality and quantity of their grapes. Their grapes even fetch higher prices at the market. It helps the environment by reducing the amount of cleared land needed for orchards and the amount of water needed to keep the plants moist. As mayor, Elaine plans to use the empty fields to start a city-run grape orchard. She and local farmers can practice and display their innovative methods there. Farmers can use plants from the orchard to start a healthier crop in their own fields. Vote for Elaine!</p>
<p>Elaine says, &ldquo;This city needs to come together to bring new life to our grape industry. With the city government organizing and funding these efforts, everyone will be on board, and we just can&rsquo;t go wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Website 3: Norman No-Tax</h3>
<p>I just want to say thank you to all my fellow farmers for supporting my campaign so far. It is difficult to stand tall against the major political parties, without a party of my own behind me. However, my neighbors and friends are all the party I need. We know what&rsquo;s best for Concord City. I have lived here all my life, planted my first grapevine at four years of age. When the city has kept taxes on our farm families to an absolute minimum, we prospered. We have been able to expand our equipment and fields. Our crops are better, and we sell more at higher prices. This is what Concord City needs to doâ€”get back to taking care of its farmers. We are the backbone of this city. Without us, there would be no families sending kids to school, no grocery store selling local grapes and jams and juice, no Concord City. I hope all of you will turn out for my next fundraiser, starting after the close of Saturday&rsquo;s farmers&rsquo; market. The high school band will be playing, and I will give a speech about how government needs to take a step back and let the farmers run their own farms once again, without city interference. Come on out and support Farmer&rsquo;s First!</p>

<h3>Website 4: Rita Republican</h3>
<p>Rita is a 20-year resident of Concord City. As a former Concord City police officer, she is tough on crime. She believes that Concord City&rsquo;s future lies in increasing jobs by bringing new businesses to the area. One famous jam company hopes to build a factory in Concord City. The factory would increase jobs in the area and would have to pay taxes to the city. The city would grow without government having to increase its control through taxing or special programs. People would move into the area to work in the factory. The factory would be a constant customer for the farmers&rsquo; grapes. It&rsquo;s a bright, grape-filled future for Concord City with Rita Republican!</p>
