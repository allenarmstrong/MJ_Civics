   <h2>How can maps explain why things are located in certain places?</h2>
   <p>Lesson 1 of 5:</p>
   <p>Many factors affect why people build structures and live their lives in certain places. Here we will focus on the geography-related factors influencing these choices.
     Examine this activity to learn about the relationship between physical geography and human culture.
     (Image is a map of a city or possibly two neighboring cities. There is a large body of land taking up the lower half of the map. A river separates the large body of land and a smaller body of land in the top right corner, where we see a few buildings and a road. There are docks that can be seen along the river banks. A hotspot marks a bridge which connects these two bodies of land near the middle of the map. The water seems to be at its most narrow here. From the bridge a main street can be seen and it runs diagonally to the bottom right corner of the map. We see a number of businesses listed at this end of the street including a hotspot on for an arcade. Other smaller streets run left and right and top to bottom as we move to the left of this main road. In the bottom left of the map we can see a hotspot for school and homes. There appears to be a large residential area with many homes. And just on the edge of the residential area is a school. Both the homes and school are surrounded by green trees and possibly some parks.)
     Move over a hotspot for more information.
     Hotspot descriptions:
     Homes: Why do homes seem to be concentrated in areas separate from businesses?
     Feedback: Places of business attract a lot of traffic from people and vehicles. As towns grow in size and population, leaders creates “zones” designated for different activities. People prefer to live in their homes away from the hustle and bustle of businesses. Business owners prefer to be visible to as many people as possible, to attract customers, so business districts tend to be near main roads. 
     School: Why did people select this location for a school?
     Feedback: As population grows, communities need more schools. This land likely was already flat and ready for building the necessary structures for a large school with play areas. The land needed to have proper drainage to prevent flooding. Leaders looked at population maps of the area and used census data to see what neighborhoods were growing and were farthest from existing schools. They looked at roads in the area to make sure transportation to the new school would not cause a traffic jam or accidents. They may need to widen roads to accommodate increased traffic.
     Arcade: Why did the arcade owners chose to open their business here?
     Feedback: As business owners, the wanted to be visible from the main roads to attract customers. The owners made sure their business is in a zone where the city allows businesses to operate. They studied maps of the area, including population statistics, to find neighborhoods with the most children, their target audience. They also considered wireless internet and cell service in the area, making sure their customers could take advantage of the latest gaming technologies. The owners also considered how close the location is to supply and distribution centers carrying products their business needs.
     Bridge: Why did people select this location to build a bridge?
     Feedback: The road, along with vacant land to support the building of the bridge entries, may have already existed. The area on either side of the bridge may be densely populated and need the link. Topographical maps helped determine the specific bridge design. The water depth may have been more suitable here and the river less wide, easing the building process and costs. </p>

  <h2>The “Best” Route:</h2>
  <p>Lesson 2 of 5:</p>
  <p>A Common challenge people face with maps is choosing a travel route between points. Examine this image to chose your route from school to the skate park.
    Imagine you ride your bike daily from school to the skate park. You travel one mile per five minutes on the roads with no stops. You travel a half mile per five minutes on roads with stop lights and other obstacles. Determine the length of each route and how long each would take you to travel from school to the skate park.
    (Image is a street map of a town and is labeled ”Which Route would you take?”. A map scale shows us one inch is equal to one mile. School is on the right of the map and the skate park is on the left. Route A is marked with the color orange, moving down one mile and connecting to a stop light, then moving left two and a half miles meeting up with two stop lights and crossing a railway track. Route B is marked with the color yellow, moving up one mile, then moving left three miles and down one mile, no obstacles are met. )
    Feedback for those who picked A: Route A is three and a half miles long and will take you 35 minutes. Route B is five miles long and will take you 25 minutes. The route you chose will depend whether your greater concern is speed or distance. The shortest route is not always the quickest.
    Feedback for those who picked B: Route B is five miles long and will take you 25 minutes. Route A is three and a half miles long and will take you 35 minutes. The route you chose will depend whether your greater concern is speed or distance. The shortest route is not always the quickest.</p>

    <h2>Time Zones:</h2>
    <p>Lesson 3 of 5:</p>
    <p>People communicate daily with others around the world. A time-zone map helps people plan travel and contact friends, family, and business partners at appropriate times. Examine this time-zone map and practice determining time differences.
      (Image of a map of the world projected in a “Mercator” style. There are lines running from the top to bottom to divide the continents and countries into smaller sections. The sections are labeled from the far left to the far right in the following order; -10, -9, -8, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, +6, +7, +8, +9, +1-, +11. Zero “0” Marks the Greenwich Meridian Time “GMT” and is where the Earth’s lines of longitude begin. As you move through time zones to the east of a location, add that number of hours to the current time in the old time zone. As we move west, we will subtract time.)</p>
    <p>Question 1 of 7:</p>
    <p>You are in Chicago, Illinois, at 5 p.m. Your email pals in Osaka, Japan, asked you to call between 9 and 10 a.m. their time. Should you call now?
      
      (Image is a map of the Earth’s time-zones. Chicago is marked as being -5 hours from GMT, and Osaka is marked as being +9 hours from GMT)

  <h2>Choosing a location:</h2>
  <p><br />
    Lesson 4 of 5:<br /><br />
    Try this activity to propose a solution for this transportation issue.<br /><br />
    The leaders of Finance City and Funville wish to build a high-speed train between them to help relieve traffic congestion. Many people commute between the cities for work and leisure. The residents cannot agree on the path the train should follow. Based on the following map, which do you think is the better route to build a high-speed train system between Finance City and Funville?<br /><br />
    (Image shows a map from an elevated angle, as if you were on a hill looking down at the cities below.<br />
    On the map are Finance City in the bottom left corner, Funville on the right side, half way up the map, and another city called Outlier closer to the to the middle of the top edge of this map. There is publicly owned land here between Funville and Outlier. Two rivers run between Finance City and Funville, and between both of the rivers are plots of land. To the left we see public land is marked with a gray section, on the right of the map we see a privately owned land with a farmhouse and field marking the area. Between Finance City and Outlier, after crossing the rivers, there are a number of changes in the elevation due to rolling hillsides. <br />
    Route A travels on a northern path from Finance City across the first river, through public land, and across the second river. It then travels over or through the hillside in order to pass near Outlier and from here it crosses more public land to reach Funville.<br />
    Route B travels on a southern path from Finance City, crossing the first river and through the flat privately owned farmlands, across the second river to reach Funville.)</p>
  <p>Select a route to view feedback:<br />
    Feedback:<br />
    <br />
    Route A:<br />
    You chose the northern route between Finance City and Funville. Engineers face the challenges of an almost completely hilly landscape on this route. The train system will have to change elevation often, or workers will have to clear vegetation and flatten hills. The land along the route is publicly owned, so there will be no issues of trying to get residents to sell land. The residents of Outlier may appreciate the opportunity to have a stop along the route.</p>
  <p><br />
    Route B:<br />
    You chose the southern route between Finance City and Funville. Engineers face the challenges of crossing two rivers, but otherwise the land is already flat. Elevation will not be an issue. Farmers privately own some of the land, and they will have to leave their land and receive pay for it. This may slow down or even stop construction if the farmers do not wish to relocate.  </p>
