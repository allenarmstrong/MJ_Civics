<h2>The Civil Rights Movement Text Version</h2>
<p>The Civil Rights Movement is famous for the many songs that people sang to emphasize their goals. Americans from across the nation gathered in Washington, D.C. in 1963. They showed support for laws that would protect equal rights for African Americans. They heard civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King speak to the importance of their cause. &ldquo;We Shall Overcome&rdquo; is one of the most famous songs the marchers sang there. Many artists recorded their own versions of the song.</p>
<div class="indent">
<blockquote>
<p>We shall overcome,<br>
  We shall overcome,<br>
  We shall overcome, some day.</p>
  <p>Oh, deep in my heart,<br>
  I do believe<br>
  We shall overcome, some day.</p>
  <p>We'll walk hand in hand, <br>
  We'll walk hand in hand, <br>
  We'll walk hand in hand, some day.</p>
  <p>Oh, deep in my heart,<br>
  I do believe<br>
  We shall overcome, some day.</p>
  <p>We shall live in peace, <br>
  We shall live in peace, <br>
  We shall live in peace, some day.</p>
  <p>Oh, deep in my heart,<br>
  I do believe<br>
  We shall overcome, some day.</p>
  <p>We are not afraid, <br>
  We are not afraid, <br>
  We are not afraid, TODAY</p>
  <p>Oh, deep in my heart,<br>
  I do believe<br>
  We shall overcome, some day.</p>
  <p>The whole wide world around<br>
  The whole wide world around<br>
  The whole wide world around some day</p>
  <p>Oh, deep in my heart,<br>
  I do believe<br>
  We shall overcome, some day.</p>

<p>(Image from the March on Washington) Music can be a powerful tool in shaping history. Combining words and music makes a person think as well as feel. Emotion can have a great effect on a person&rsquo;s choices, inspiring them to act. Music is powerful way to generate emotion in people and lead to choices that change history. This image captures that spirit as people hold a <strong>sit-in</strong> at a barbershop where an African American was refused service in 1964.</p>

 <p>&ldquo;Dr. King's Dream&rdquo;—A Segment of: Days That Shook the World: 1955–1986</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>On August 28, 1963, some 200,000 people marched through Washington 
in the biggest political demonstration the capital had ever seen. The issue—civil rights for the country's 20 million black minority. Dr. Martin Luther King had already led similar protests in the southern states against discrimination in schools, on public transport, in shops and restaurants. This was taking the fight to the heart of the country itself, and it struck a chord in American consciousness. Within a year, though there were many setbacks on the way, an act was signed prohibiting discrimination in employment, hotels, and government jobs. On the day, the organizers thought they'd be lucky to get 100,000 supporters out onto the streets. In the event, more than double that number turned up—film stars and politicians, whites and blacks from all sections of the community. inspired by the rhetoric of Dr. King himself and by the song that became the battle hymn of the civil-rights movement.</p>
<blockquote><p>...someday-ay<br>oh, deep in my heart<br>heart<br>I do believe<br>we shall overcome<br>someday<br>we shall overcome<br>we shall overcome<br>someday<br>oh, deep...</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a dream that one day...this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed—"we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. "I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream.</p>
<p>Tragically, before that dream could be fully realized, Dr. King died at the hands of an assassin in 1968. But his inspiration lived on and changed the history of race relations in the United States forever.</p>

<h3>Migrant Farm Workers during the Great Depression</h3>
<p>Dorothea Lange, working for the U.S. government, took this photograph in 1936. Her job was to document the lives of migrant farm workers. Florence Thompson was a 32-year old mother of six when Lange photographed her near a migrant farm workers&rsquo; camp in California. She had traveled with her family from Oklahoma. Her husband had recently died and the family car was broken down. Americans saw this image of a hungry, dirty, anxious woman and her children. They demanded government action to bring relief to the migrant workers.</p>

<p>The Great Depression was a time of economic hardship across the United States. Farmers in the Plains states had a particularly tough time. Their land was worn out and weather conditions made things worse. Many headed west, like Florence Thompson, hoping for a better life. Watch this video to learn more.</p>

<p>The Dust Bowl–A Segment of: Just the Facts: The Emergence of Modern America: The Great Depression</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>In previous decades, many farmers and frontiersman settled in the Great Plains. Due to the rich soil and steady rainfall, made growing crops a dependable way of life. The advent of new machinery like the reaper and the tractor made farming large plots of land much easier. But what many of these farmers failed to realize was that buy continually tilling and growing on the same plots of land, they were actually depleting the soil of its nutrients. This alone would not necessarily spell disaster. But in 1931, just as the great depression was settling in throughout the country, a massive drought struck the plains. The effect of the drought was compounded by a record heat wave.</p>
<p>Farmers had been struggling with food surpluses and high shipping rates and low purchase prices for years. But now, they were forced to watch their crops wither away before their eyes. The situation worsened. Gusting winds blew across the crackling, nutrient-stripped soil, causing blinding dust storms. Families were forced to take cover at the onslaught of the storms and farm animals left exposed were often killed. The population was devastated, but only rain could offer relief. Rain did not come and the region soon came to be called The Dust Bowl.</p>
<p>When it looked like life in the plains couldn't get any harder, it did. Fueled by the hot dry climate, plagues of locusts swarmed over the farmland; eating the leaves from every plant they passed. Farmers did what they could to feed their families, but as the drought persevered, farm prices steadily decreased. And the threat of bank foreclosure loomed. It became clear too many that moving west was the only option.</p>
<p>California was unaffected by the drought and offered farming jobs to migrate workers, who would do seasonal labor for low wages. Many former landowners from The Dust Bowl packed all their belongings in the family automobile and headed out west in search of this kind of labor. California farmers nicknamed the groups Okies, a derogatory term for people who came from the Oklahoma area. At first there was work to be found, but as the drought wore on, and more and more families left the Plains, the jobs in California became harder to come by.</p>
</div>
<p>The people who moved to California during the <strong>Dust Bowl</strong> did not find a land of riches. They became migrant farm workers, following harvest seasons. For example, when it was time to pick potatoes people headed to potato farms asking for work. Then they would move on to the next farm needing work. However, so many people competed for the same jobs that the migrants often had trouble finding work. The U.S. government set up camps where the people could live for a short while. The conditions were poor. Other people looked down on them and were sometimes cruel. The John Steinbeck novel <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> describes the challenges of one migrant family from the Dust Bowl and how they stuck together to survive. The novel also helped bring attention and concern to the struggles of migrant farm workers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okie use' ta mean you was from Oklahoma. Now it means … you're scum. Don't mean nothing itself, it's the way they say it.&rdquo;<br>
  The Grapes of Wrath<br>
  Chapter 18</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you frighten a man whose hunger is not only in his own cramped stomach but in the wretched bellies of his children? You can't scare him--he has known a fear beyond every other.&rdquo;<br>
The Grapes of Wrath<br>
