  <p>[Interviewer] How did you get the idea for your business?</p>
    <p>[Nick Doherty] So I got an iTouch for my birthday a few years ago. And when I was looking at the apps, I realized that they all were horrible. And I knew I could make them a lot better .. um so... and I wanted too. And I thought that would be a really fun project. So, I went to Stanford for three weeks to take  courses on programming. Then when I came back I did a little more studying and started practicing. It just progressed until it got to where it is now.</p>

    <p>[Interviewer] What have you learned from starting and running a business?</p>

    <p>[Interviewer] What motivated you to start the business?</p>
    <p>[Nick Doherty] So, besides the fact that I wanted to improve the apps in the App Store from when  I got the iTouch for my birthday. I also wanted a lot of spending money in my pocket. And I knew that doing apps would be a very good way to do that.</p>
    
    <p>[Interviewer] Has that been successful for you?</p>

    <p>[Interviewer] What advice would you give another teen looking to start a business?</p>
    <p>[Nick Doherty] I would say you just have to have one really good idea. Something that you love to do. And then find a way to make money from that. Then just devote a lot of time to it. And keep working at it, because it doesn't come easy. It comes with time.</p>
