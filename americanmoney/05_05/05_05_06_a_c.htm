<h2>Watchdog Discussion Chart Text Version</h2>
<h3>Step 1–Identify Local Governments at Work</h3>
<p>In this step you should identify what you can see in your community that is a result of local government. All members of your team should explore the news through newspapers, websites, radio, or other means. Ask trusted adults questions about what you see to be sure that local government is responsible for the action.</p>
<h3>Step 2–hare with Your Team</h3>
<p>As a team, discuss the ways you see local government at work in your communities. You will probably have similar items, but discussion may lead you to other examples you had not considered. If your team members live in different areas, you may find that some efforts are a priority in one community but not another. Make a list of the actions and the communities to which each applies in the first two columns of the chart below. One example appears for you to help start your discussion. Add rows as necessary.</p>
<h3>Step 3–Identify and Plan Evidence Collection</h3>
<p>Continue the discussion with your team by listing the artifacts, or pieces of evidence, that would prove the actions you came up with actually happen. Each member of your team should collect at least four artifacts. Each artifact should be unique. However, you could have evidence of the same activity happening in two different communities, such as a picture of roadwork in one city and roadwork in another city. Your artifacts can come in many different forms, all of one type or a mix of these:</p>
<ul>
  <li>pictures or drawings</li>
  <li>short video clips</li>
  <li>newspaper or website articles</li>
  <li>radio broadcast recording</li>
  <li>interview with local official or community resident</li>
  <li>interview with workers paid by local government</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the team&rsquo;s ideas in the third column of the chart below.</p>

<p>As a team, you need to make choices about what evidence each of you will collect. You should include a parent or guardian as well since you may need transportation to collect your evidence. Write notes about each artifact, explaining what it is and what it tells you about the work of local government. Your team also needs to discuss how you will put it together into one &ldquo;Watchdog Portfolio.&rdquo; The portfolio can be as simple as a word processing file or as complex as a team website. You will need to discuss this with your team.</p>
