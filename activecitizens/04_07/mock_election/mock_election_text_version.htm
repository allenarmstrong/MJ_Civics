<h2>Mock Election Text Version</h2><p><strong>Rita Republican</strong>: Welcome to Concord City! I am the mayor, Rita Republican. We are so glad you have become a resident in our wonderful city. We are famous for our high-quality Concord grapes&mdash;the tastiest in the nation! Folks here grow them and process them into juices, jams, and other products. Even residents who are not farmers are involved in the grape industry. For example, some sell grapes or the grape products to outside companies. Others research better growing methods or sell necessary equipment and supplies. The grocery store sells our yummy local products. </p>
<p>You will learn more about the city as you explore. It is an exciting time to be here; we have an election coming up! One of our most important issues is a recent drought. The lack of rain has been hard on many of our farmers and the grape orchards. As mayor, I have been working hard with residents to find solutions to this challenge. I am nearing the end of my first term as mayor and am running for re-election. This makes me the incumbent candidate. You will have to register right away so that you can vote in the election. Concord City requires voters to register at least 29 days before the election in order to vote in the election. See you around!</p>
