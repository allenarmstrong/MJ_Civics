<h2>Laws Text Version</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p>The officer and Brian meet again! Help Brian choose how to respond to the officer's questions.</p>
  <p>Officer: Hello again, Brian. I trust that you are aware of the time. It is quite close to curfew.</p>
  <h4>Question 1</h4>
  <p>How should Brian respond?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Of course. I found in our local newspaper that we now have a curfew of 10 p.m., passed by our city council. I may not agree with it, but it is law so I must follow it. </li>
    <li>Of course. However, the Constitution does not mention any curfew, so I don't think I have to follow a local curfew law.</li>
  </ol>
 
    <p>[Officer] You make a good point. How does a teen like you know so much about the effects of laws?</p>
  <h4>Question 2</h4>
<p>How should Brian respond?</p>
   <ol>
   <li>I learn about laws only from you, my classes, and my parents. I have no other reliable source of information.</li>
   <li>I learned that I can find information about laws at all levels of governmentâ€”local, state, and federal. Web sites have information on past laws, present laws, even bills under debate. I can learn what people think about them through the media.</li>
   </ol>

 <p>[Officer] I am glad you have learned so much. Head on home and have a great night!</p>
