<h1>Plan!</h1>
<p>You should now have an issue or problem in your community that you would like to focus on for your service project. Perhaps you know what you would like to do to help. It is OK if you do not know yet. This step will help you plan your service. Remember that the goal is to help others. Ask the people you wish to help what would be most valuable to them.</p>
<p>Community groups have great information. Examples include the Red Cross, the Rotary Club, and Habitat for Humanity, and they are known as <span class="tooltip">nonprofit organizations<span><strong>Nonprofit Organizations:</strong> a group of people organized to achieve some purpose that does not include making a profit</span></span> purpose that does not include making a profit.These groups exist to serve others rather than to make money. You may find it helpful to work with an existing service organization to complete your service project. Leaders of these groups already have contacts and resources in place. They will have ideas for how you can best help. You may be able to assist with an event they are planning. Many activities will have an age requirement. Do not be discouraged! Be creative and suggest ways you can contribute. You can visit the course discussion area to get ideas for service from your classmates.</p>
