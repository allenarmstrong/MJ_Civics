<h2>Terms Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Civil Case</strong><br />
  A civil case is a lawsuit brought before a court relating to the rights of citizens and groups. It is usually a dispute between citizens, businesses, or even branches of government. This is different from a criminal case, where a person is accused of breaking a law.</p>

<p><strong>Appeal</strong><br />
An appeal is a formal request to a higher judicial authority requesting a change of decision, such as a case to a higher court. Appellate courts, or courts of appeal, can review the decisions of judges made in trial courts.</p>

<p><strong>Committee</strong><br />
A committee is a subgroup of a legislative assembly that meets to discuss and debate a specific issue in detail. Members make recommendations to the whole legislature. Most of the debate over and changes to bills take place in committee meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Bill</strong><br />
A bill is a written form of an idea for a proposed law. People and lawmakers debate bills in meetings and committees. Bills must follow a complex process to become a law, whether at the state or national level. Many factors influence a lawmaker's decision whether or not to support a bill.</p>

<p><strong>State Legislature</strong><br />
A state legislature is the part of a state government responsible for making laws that apply within the state. Most states have a bicameral legislature, meaning it has two parts. For example, Florida has a Senate and a House of Representatives.</p>

<p><strong>Rule of Law</strong><br />
Rule of law is the principle that both those who govern and those who are governed must obey the laws and are subject to the same laws. Everyone in the United States must obey the laws. This protects the wellbeing of everyone. People who break the law face consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Federalism</strong><br />
Federalism is the division of powers among local, state, and national governments. The U.S. Constitution delegates powers to the national government. The Tenth Amendment reserves other powers to the states. State constitutions organize how local governments will work.</p>

<p><strong>Public Policy</strong><br />
Public policy is a course of action accepted or used by a government to respond to a problem. Citizens can play an important role in helping create public policy. They bring attention to issues and problems. They can contact officials and other people. Citizens can help determine the best civic actions to address the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Judicial Review</strong><br />
Judicial review is the power to review and cancel laws or acts of government if they are determined to be unconstitutional. Many cases in the U.S. Supreme Court relate to whether or not certain laws conflict with the Constitution.</p>

<p><strong>Concurrent Powers</strong><br />
Concurrent powers are powers shared by the national, state, and/or local governments. Examples include the power to tax and to provide special help to citizens.</p>
