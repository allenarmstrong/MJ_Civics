  <p>Lesson 1 of 5:</p>
  <p><em>Image of a young boy and girl facing each other.</em></p>
  <p>Screen 1 of 5:</p>
  <p>Boy: So I know how to locate places on maps and identify features like symbols and the scale. Is there anything else we can do with maps?  </p>
  <p>Screen 2 of 5:</p>
  <p>Girl: Absolutely! You may have heard the phrase “a picture is worth a thousand words.” Well, a map is worth, like, a million! By analyzing and interpreting the features on maps, you can learn so much about your world besides where to find mountains and borders.  </p>
  <p>Screen 3 of 5:</p>
  <p>Boy: What’s the difference between analyzing and interpreting?</p>
  <p>Screen 4 of 5:</p>
  <p>Girl: Good question! Analysis is comparing features on maps and between different maps. You identify patterns and look for connections when you analyze a map. Interpretation is taking the next step with a map by asking why those patterns and connections exist.</p>
  <p>Screen 5 of 5:</p>
  <p>Boy: Wow! I guess a map really is worth a million words! Thanks so much!</p>

  <p>Lesson 3 of 5:</p>
  <p>You can learn more information by comparing different maps. Use your analysis from each map to identify connections between them. Technology enables us to combine different maps for easy comparison.</p>
  <p><em>Image showing two different maps of the United States.</em></p>
  <p><em>U.S. Regions (left)</em></p>
  <p><em>U.S. map, divided into sections; each section a different color. Northeastern states are colored blue. Southern states are colored green. Midwestern states are colored yellow. Western states are colored red. Yellow dots are placed on the western region, the southern region, and the northeastern region.</em>  </p>

  <p>Rollover the hotspots to compare these maps.  </p>
  <p>U.S. Regions: West </p>
  <p><em>(Text displayed on rollover) </em>The West had the most people coming in from the Northeast and Midwest but nearly as many people going out to the South. This includes the state of California.  </p>
  <p><em>Image of dotted line from U.S. Regions map (western region) to U.S. Net Regional U.S. Migration, 2007 Map (western region)</em>  </p>
  <p>U.S. Regions: South</p>
  <p><em>(Text displayed on rollover) </em>Florida is part of the South, so it is part of the region with the largest net incoming migration.  </p>

  <p>U.S. Regions: Northeast</p>
  <p><em>(Text displayed on rollover) </em>New York is in the Northeast, part of the region that lost more people than it gained from 2005 to 2007.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Lesson 4 of 5:</p>
<p>Interpretation is another skill related to map analysis. When you interpret a map, you ask why the features and patterns you analyzed exist. You also consider why and for whom the information is important. You may even make a prediction. Interpreting maps can lead to further questions for study and research.</p>
<p>Examine the map for possible interpretations and ideas for further exploration.</p>

<p>Net Regional U.S. Migration, 2007</p>
  <p><em>(Text displayed on rollover)</em> The cartographer made this map from U.S. Census data. The main Census every 10 years determines funding for programs and representation in Congress. The map was created possibly to help regional leaders predict and plan for the 2010 U.S. Census.</p>
  <p>West</p>
  <p><em>(Text displayed on rollover)</em> California attracts many people to its beautiful coastline and weather. It is possible that the migration out of the West was mostly from other states.</p>
  <p>South</p>
  <p><em>(Text displayed on rollover)</em><strong> “Net Migration”</strong> shows only the difference between people moving out and those moving in from the whole region. That does not mean every state in the South gained more people than it lost.</p>
  <p>South</p>
  <p><em>(Text displayed on rollover)</em> Net migration was out of the Northeast to all other regions. With so many large cities in that region, perhaps more Americans are interested in country living than before.</p>
