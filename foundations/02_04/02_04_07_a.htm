  <tr>
  <td valign="top"> Federalism</td>
  <td valign="top"> Division of powers among the local, state, and federal governments </td>
  <td valign="top"> The Articles of Confederation gave final authority to the state governments, creating conflict between states. For example, if one state passed a law that affected citizens visiting from another state, no one could settle the dispute. Also, the federal government had no way to protect the people and nation as a whole.</td>
  <td valign="top"> Article VI of the Constitution makes federal laws supreme over state laws. Article IV of the Constitution says the states must respect each other&rsquo;s laws and explains the duties of the federal government to protect the states. Article I of the Constitution allows the federal government to create and maintain a national military force to protect the nation. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top"> Limited Government</td>
  <td valign="top"> Idea that government should be restricted to its basic function of protecting people&rsquo;s natural rights</td>
  <td valign="top"> Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government was too weak and limited. For example, it could pass laws but not enforce them.</td>
  <td valign="top"> The Constitution expanded and listed the powers of the federal government. Through Article I, Congress could raise taxes. Article II establishes the president as the leader of the military. Articles I(One), II (Two), and III (Three) expanded federal power but still limited it by dividing its powers into the three branches and by specifying who is qualified to serve in each branch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top"> Individual Rights</td>
  <td valign="top"> Specific rights that belong to each person</td>
  <td valign="top"> The Articles of Confederation did not list specific rights of citizens. It also did not provide a way for people to settle disputes over their rights as citizens of the nation.</td>
  <td valign="top"> The Constitution established a judicial branch of government. Through the courts citizens may seek solutions to disputes over rights. In addition, the Bill of Rights is the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. It includes individual rights the government must respect.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top"> Popular Sovereignty</td>
  <td valign="top"> Idea that government exists by consent of the people, who have the greatest authority in making political decisions</td>
  <td valign="top"> The Articles of Confederation gave each state only one vote in making decisions. Therefore, states with small populations had as much power as states with large populations. Also, nine of the 13 states had to agree to any new law, more than a simple majority. Agreement of so many states was difficult to achieve, making progress slow.</td>
  <td valign="top"> Under the Constitution, the people elect those who represent them. They influence decisions and have authority through voting. Article I of the Constitution changed the one vote per state idea to a system that considered population and majority agreement. Article V created an amendment process that is difficult but does not require unanimous consent. However, it does give the states an important role in the process. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top"> Republic</td>
  <td valign="top"> Form of government where qualified voters elect representatives who carry out the work of government and are responsible to the people</td>
  <td valign="top"> Under the Articles of Confederation, the state legislatures chose who would serve in the legislative branch. Voters had no say in who represented them in federal government.</td>
  <td valign="top"> Article I of the Constitution specifies that voters would choose their representatives in the federal government. Every few years the voters would vote again, possibly replacing their leaders. The representatives would have to respond to people&rsquo;s concerns to do their job well. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td valign="top"> Separation of Powers</td>
  <td valign="top"> Dividing government powers into legislative, executive, and judicial branches</td>
  <td valign="top"> Under the Articles of Confederation, there was only one branch of government. It could make laws. However, it could not enforce laws or settle disputes about the laws.</td>
  <td valign="top"> The first three articles of the Constitution describe the powers of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td valign="top"> Checks and Balances</td>
  <td valign="top"> Division and balance of powers between the branches of power to prevent any one branch from taking over the others</td>
  <td valign="top"> The Founding Fathers made the Articles of Confederation weak because they feared tyranny. It was so weak, however, that it sometimes failed to serve the nation&rsquo;s needs. </td>
  <td valign="top"> The Founding Father divided the powers in articles I, II, and III of the Constitution. They also gave each branch specific means to &ldquo;check,&rdquo; or limit the powers of the other branches. This helps balance power between the branches so no one group can take over the government.</td>
