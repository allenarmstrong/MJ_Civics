<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>
<p>You are a part of a team planning and creating a great new game called &ldquo;Citizenship Quest.&rdquo; The mission of your group is to teach others how all people in a community can have good citizenship. You especially want to show other teens what they can do each day to act like a good citizen.</p>
<p>Your team&rsquo;s task is to brainstorm all the ways people can show good citizenship in their everyday lives. You will use this information to create a game. The game&rsquo;s purpose is to teach others about good citizenship in a fun way.</p>
<h3>Step 1—Brainstorm Ways to Show Good Citizenship</h3>
<p>Create a list of ways people can act as good citizens each day. Include ideas from family and other friends. It would be a great idea to put your ideas into groups. This may help your team create the game. Brainstorm as a team through the discussion board or other method approved by your instructor. Each team member should contribute at least five ways to show good citizenship. Your team should use the Citizenship Brainstorm List to keep track. Determine who will collect the ideas into one document.</p>
<h3>Step 2—Plan the Game</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>Game Planning Sheet</strong> to plan the details of your game. Each team member should discuss and contribute ideas. Each idea should include the name of the team member who shared it. Determine who will collect the ideas from all team members into one version of this document.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Be sure to ask your parent&rsquo;s or guardian&rsquo;s permission before visiting these websites. The following websites may help if your team wishes to create an online game:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Playcrafter (http://www.playcrafter.com/)</li>
  <li>PurposeGames (http://www.purposegames.com/create)</li>
  <li>Sploder (http://www.sploder.com/)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3—Design the Game</h3>
<p>This is the part where your team carries out the plans in the Game Planning Sheet. Be sure to communicate often with your team members. Check with each other on progress and offer help or solutions to issues that arise. When the game is complete, it should be shared with the whole team through pictures, video, or a link (if it is an online game).</p>
<h3>Step 4—Play and Edit the Game</h3>
<p>You have to make sure it works! Each team member should play the game. Check that the rules make sense and the game works as planned. Discuss with team members any changes the game may need. When all team members are happy with the game, you are ready to turn it in and share it with others!</p>
<p>Be sure your Citizenship Quest Game contains the names of all your team members.</p>
<h3>Step 5—Submit to Instructor</h3>
<p>There are two parts to your work in this collaboration activity. View the Grading Rubrics before completing and submitting this activity.</p>
