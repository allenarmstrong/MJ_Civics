<h2>Types of Government: Answers Text Version</h2>
<h3>Slide 1</h3>
<p>The three main types of government differ in how much power the people have in making decisions. They are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>democracy</li>
    <li>oligarchy</li>
    <li>autocracy</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Slide 2</h3>
  <p>A<strong> democracy</strong> is a government run by the people, either directly or indirectly.</p>
  <p>There are two types of democracies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A direct democracy is a form of government where the laws are made directly by the citizens. A true direct democracy would be very difficult to achieve. It would require all citizens to take part in making decisions.</li>
    <li>A representative democracy, or republic, is a government that is run indirectly by the people. This means that the people elect representatives to make decisions for them. We can call the United States a representative democracy or republic.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Slide 3</h3>
<p>An<strong> oligarchy </strong>is a government run by a few people or a small group of people.</p>
  <p>A single political party often runs an oligarchy. Leaders of the party have the highest positions in government. All decisions for the nation are in line with the party’s ideas.</p>
<h3>Slide 4</h3>
<p>An <strong>autocracy </strong>is a<strong> </strong>government run by one person.</p>
  <p>There are several types of autocracies. One type is a monarchy. A monarchy is a government run by a King or Queen. Usually a monarchy is hereditary. This means that each new king or queen is a family member of the previous one, usually a son or daughter. In general, the monarch rules for life.</p>
  <p>Another type of autocracy is a dictatorship. A dictator is one person who rules a nation by force. The dictator makes all government decisions, sometimes with advice from advisors with similar views. Dictators intend to rule for life.</p>
  <h3>Slide 5</h3>
  <p>People usually discuss<strong> socialism </strong>and<strong> communism</strong> together; however, these are two separate ideas. Socialism is actually an economic system. It limits individual choice and ownership. Socialists believe all resources should be shared and used to benefit everyone.</p>
  <p>Communism is a type of government where the communist party is the most powerful. The goal of a communist party is to put socialist ideas into practice. Its leaders make the important economic decisions. Examples include where to build stores, who will manage them, and what crops to grow.</p>
    <p>Communist governments are usually run by one person or a small group of people that believes in socialism. Therefore, we can describe these governments as either autocracies or oligarchies, depending on the structure of the specific nation. Communist governments often have to keep power by force and limit trade with other nations. They try to meet most of their needs with the resources available in the nation.<br>
    (Karl Marx was a philosopher. Many communist nations base their governments on his ideas.)</p>
