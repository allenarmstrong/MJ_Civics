<h2>Waymarking and Geocaching Tips</h2>
<h3>Permission</h3>
<p>You need to discuss these activities with a parent or guardian. They will have to learn about geocaching and waymarking with you. The lists of existing sites are on websites outside of this course. In   addition, someone has to go with you!</p>
<h3>Follow the law</h3>
<p>You must obey the law. You may not roam on private property. Some laws restrict where you can hide a geocache or what can be in it.</p>
<h3>Civic duty</h3>
<p>Remember to include others in the activity. Family and friends can have fun. Everyone can learn about the environment or culture of where you live.</p>
<h3>Fun</h3>
<p>It's a treasure hunt! Smile and have fun.</p>
