<h1>Objectives</h1>
<p>Real events in the United States inspired a situation similar to the one you just heard. When the <span class="tooltip">Founding Fathers<span><strong>Founding Fathers:</strong> name given to the early leaders of the United States who helped design the nation's government</span></span> wrote the Constitution and the <span class="tooltip">Bill of Rights<span><strong>Bill of Rights:</strong> the first 10 amendments to the Constitution</span></span>, they could not possibly know every situation where their words would apply. They knew this and wrote the <span class="tooltip">U.S. Constitution<span><strong>U.S. Constitution:</strong> plan detailing the structure, functions, and powers of the government of the United States, also known as the Constitution</span></span> in a way that allows it to be applied in a wide range of situations.</p>
<p>Let's learn more about how the Constitution safeguards and limits individual rights.</p>

<p>In 1965, Mary Beth Tinker and John Tinker wore these armbands to school. The armbands had two meanings for them. One was to mourn those who died in the Vietnam conflict going on at the time. The other meaning was the hope for peace and a quick end to the conflict. Adults including their parents also wore the armbands.</p>
<p>The Tinkers were suspended from school for wearing the armbands. The school banned the armbands before the Tinkers wore them there. However, the students and their parents believed they had the right to free speech in school, just as they would anywhere else. At first, their parents challenged the school board's rule in their state court. Each time they lost the case, they challenged the ruling. Eventually, their case went to the Supreme Court!</p>
