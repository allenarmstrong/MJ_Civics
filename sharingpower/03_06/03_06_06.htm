<h1>Are There Other Types of Jurisdiction?</h1>
<p>A court's jurisdiction can be very specific. State court systems set up trial courts to handle certain common issues. These are called courts of limited jurisdiction. For example, the function of traffic courts is to handle traffic cases, like accidents and speeding tickets. States often have courts to hear cases related to family law, like adoptions and divorces. <span class="tooltip">Juvenile<span><strong>Juvenile:</strong> referring to minors, such as juvenile courts</span></span> law is another area that has its own courts. State laws apply differently to citizens who are not yet adults. Juvenile courts specialize in handling cases where a child or teen is accused of a crime.</p>

<p>In many of these courts, people will not go and have what we normally think of as a trial, complete with judge and jury. The judicial system encourages people to find solutions to problems without entering a courtroom as much as possible. For example, those with traffic violations often pay a fine and may attend traffic school without appearing before a judge. When two or more people have a dispute, they may try <span class="tooltip">mediation<span><strong>Mediation:</strong> a process where an outside person works with people on both sides of a dispute to try and help them reach an agreement without going to court</span></span> first. In situations requiring a courtroom appearance, many times people appear only before a judge and not the whole courtroom staff. The judge will review all available <span class="tooltip">evidence<span><strong>Evidence:</strong> objects or information used in court to prove the facts of the case</span></span> before making a decision.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Teen Court? Many cities in the United States are trying a new approach to juvenile justice for minor offenses. Teen volunteers learn the jobs of a court and conduct real trials with the help of a judge! See if there is a Teen Court in your area. It's a great way to start your service project and make a positive difference in the community!</p>
