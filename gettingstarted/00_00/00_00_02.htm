        <h2>Discussion-Based Assessments</h2>
        <p>A Discussion-Based Assessment is a phone call between you, your instructor, and your parent or guardian. Your instructor will discuss the unit's topics with you to assess your knowledge and discuss your progress in the course.</p>
		<p>In addition, this is an opportunity to ask your instructor questions. You will need to contact your instructor and complete a Discussion-Based Assessment for each unit.</p>

        <p>This course requires completion of a service-learning project. Service is helping other people in the community. This project gets you away from the screen and making a difference! You may already be involved in some type of service activity that will suit this requirement. You will submit part of this project in Segment One and the other in Segment Two.</p>
        <p>Visit the Service Learning Unit early and often. Work on this project will extend over your time in this course, so planning early is important.</p>

        <h2>Pace</h2>
        <p>Pace is your rate of movement through the course. The words "rate" and "movement" suggest progress, which is required on a weekly basis. A benefit of learning online is that you determine your own schedule. 		 Adhering to that schedule, however, can be a challenge.</p>
		<p>One of your most important tasks is selecting the pace at which you will complete the course projects and lessons. As an online student, you are expected to follow the chosen pace and submit the activities for grading in a timely manner. You will need to determine your completion date and pace. Think about the following questions:</p>
        <div class="right img"><img src="images/00_00_02e.jpg" alt="Student making a schedule" /><br /><span class="imgNote">&copy; 2011 AP Images</span></div>  
		<ol>
        	<li>When would you like to be done with the course?</li> 
			<li>How much time per day or week will you have to devote to the course?</li> 
			<li>In what order do you intend to complete the units? </li>
        </ol><br /><br />
		<p>Many factors will influence your decision. Talk to your parent(s) or guardian(s), guidance counselor, and instructor to determine which pace would be best for you.</p>
