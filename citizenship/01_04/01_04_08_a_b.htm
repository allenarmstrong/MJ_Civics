<h2>Collaboration Option Text Version</h2>
<p>More than 100 environmental groups like Tampa Bay Watch are active across the United States. They focus on many different issues affecting the environment. Like Tampa Bay Watch, some may be focused on a specific issue in a local area. Others have a broader focus, working on solutions for several issues affecting places around the country or even the world. </p>
<p>Your task is to research environmental groups active in your area. You can look for a group local to your town or city, or expand to look at county or even statewide groups. Find out if there are ways that you and other teens could help their efforts. Your job as a team has two main parts. The first is to collect and evaluate information about these groups. Then your team will prepare a &ldquo;call to action&rdquo; to encourage people to help these groups. Your team will present this information to your instructor.</p>
<h3>Step 1—Identify Your Community Issue</h3>
<p>Define your environmental issue as a team. Will each of you focus on how the issue affects your local area? Will you search for different groups addressing the issue on a state or national level? Carefully defining your issue will help you locate information.</p>
<h3>Step 2—Identify Environmental Groups</h3>
<p>Each member of your group must select a different group to research. Perhaps one of you looks at a local group while another studies a national organization. You have many options. Try to focus first on groups in your local area and expand to state or national level only if you have trouble locating information. Great ways to find local groups include contacting local government offices or the public library.</p>
<p>Searching the Internet without already knowing a group&rsquo;s name is not recommended because you might find a business that charges for environmental work rather than a not-for-profit service group. The focus here is volunteer groups. Ask around your community first, and then when you have some information, you may find it helpful to locate the group&rsquo;s website, if it has one.</p>
<h3>Step 3—Prepare Research Cards</h3>
<p>Collect research about your group. Each team member should fill out at a least one research card. Look for answers to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where does this issue have an impact in my community?</li>
  <li>What is the goal of this environmental group?</li>
  <li>What actions or events has this group organized?</li>
  <li>How does the group try to involve the community? (Does it visit schools, host fundraisers, update a website, attend local government meetings?)</li>
  <li>Are there any pictures, graphs, charts, or maps available that relate to the group and the issue?</li>
  <li>Has anyone written about this group in newspapers, magazines, or official websites?</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential sources of information include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>news or magazine articles (in print or online)</li>
  <li>people concerned about or familiar with the issue</li>
  <li>PublicLibraries.com (http://www.publiclibraries.com/)</li>
  <li>resources and websites for U.S. local governments (http://www.usa.gov/Agencies/Local.shtml)</li>
</ul>
<p>virtual library (http://library.flvs.net/)</p>
<p>The Research Asset may help you with researching and organizing your information.</p>
<h3>Step 4—Share and Discuss Environmental Group Cards</h3>
<p>As a team, share and discuss the environmental groups you researched. A three-member team should have at least three cards, one from each member. Discuss the following items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you have clear information on the purpose and programs for each group?</li>
  <li>Do you have resource information for each group, such as contact information and a website?</li>
  <li>Do you have information on any upcoming events and how people can get involved?</li>
  <li>Are there ways for teens to get involved? If so, how, and do you have to live in a certain area?</li>
  <li>Do your groups work on their issues in similar ways? How are they different?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5—Prepare Call to Action</h3>
<p>As a team, choose the format you will use to present information on your issue. Your goal is to convince people to help one of these groups. It should tell them how they could help and why it is a good idea. As a team, create one of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>website</li>
    <li>poster</li>
    <li>pamphlet</li>
    <li>news or magazine feature</li>
    <li>video or podcast</li>
    <li>other format approved by instructor</li>
  </ul>
<p>Be sure your Call to Action contains the names of all your team members.</p>
<h3>Step 6—Submit to Instructor</h3>
<p>There are two parts to your work in this collaboration activity. View the Grading Rubrics before completing and submitting this activity.</p>
