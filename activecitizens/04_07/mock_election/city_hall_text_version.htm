<h2>City Hall Text Version</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Concord City Hall. Following is a city hall debate between four mayoral candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Cienna Corker, Moderator:</strong> Welcome, residents of Concord City, guests, and our distinguished candidates! Tonight we are hosing a debate between the candidates for mayor of Concord City. I am Cienna Corker, serving as moderator for this evening. Our local news offices, TGP, or The Grape Press, and Concord TV are here to cover the night's events. Residents submitted questions in advance by mail, email, and telephone. As the chosen moderator, I carefully sorted through them and chose questions based on the issues in this year's election. Voters,be sure to take notes! First, let's let each candidate introduce him or herself. Along with the introduction, each candidate should indicate what he or she believes to be the greatest issue facing Concord City. We will go from left to right, starting with Mr. David Democrat and ending with our incumbent mayor, Ms. Rita Republican.</p>
</p><p><strong>David Democrat:</strong> I appreciate all of you coming out this evening. I am David Democrat, school board member. The greatest issue facing Concord City is the state of our public schools. We can't diversify, or bring variety, to the city's workforce as my colleague Ms Republican wants without making change in the schools. We can't improve our farming techniques or even improve the finances of our farmers without preparing our students properly for the future. Fixing our schools is the greatest issue and the most powerful way to bring the change to Concord City that my fellow esteemed candidates so desire.</p>
</p><p><strong>Elaine Environs:</strong> Thank you for listening tonight, Concord City. I am Elaine Environs, agriculture science teacher at Concord High School. I teach the sons and daughters of our farming community, most of whom go home to help their parents in the grape orchards. The health of our community's greatest industry, our grapes, is the most important issue for sure. The recent drought proves that our cultivation techniques are not strong enough. We need to design our orchards to withstand changes in climate patterns. It is a good idea to reduce water use even when we do not have a drought. Water is a precious resource. We must protect water and other resources of the environment well.</p>
</p><p><strong>Norman No-Tax:</strong> Resident's, voters, students, and guests: Welcome! I am Norman No-Tax, running for the first time as mayor. However, I have been the president of the Concord Orchards Coalition for many years. We at the COC believe that a partnership with the mayor's office and city council is critical to the success of our city. Most residents are farmers. The current tax rates in our city strangle our farmers. We have a difficult time making the tax payments. Because of the taxes, we cannot afford the equipment and other goods we need to produce great grapes.</p>
</p><p><strong>Rita Republican:</strong> Good evening, distinguished residents of Concord City. I am Rita Republican, your mayor, proud of the progress we have made together these last four years. The greatest issue has been, and still is, the lack of variety in our economy. About 60 percent of our residents are farmers, which is fantastic. However, the drought and other events have impressed upon us the need to bring more options to our city as well as a stable market for our grapes. That is why I have been working toward bringing the Amazing Grapes company to our city to build a factory.</p>
</p><p><strong>Cienna Corker, Debate Moderator</strong>: Thank you, candidates. Everyone seems to agree that Concord City has some pressing issues. Though each of you has a top priority, we need to find out where everyone stands on all the concerns of our voters. Tonight we will try to distinguish how each of you plans to address these issues. Ms. Environs, I would like to start with you. We see your ads and hear you say that farmers need to change their methods. What exactly needs to change? How would this help them overcome the drought?</p>

Ms. Environs, I would like to start with you. We see your ads and hear you say that farmers need to change their methods. What exactly needs to change? How would this help them overcome the drought?</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Elaine Environs:</strong> Ms. Corker, I have been experimenting with the school's orchard for many years now. The students have helped build a new style of trellis that allows the grapevines to grow more thickly, increasing the output of grapes per square foot. Thicker, denser vines also helps trap moisture, reducing the amount of watering needed. The drought hit our farms hard because most do not use simple methods like these to protect the vines from dry conditions.</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Mr. No-Tax, you have an extensive orchard. Is Ms. Environs correct in her statements?</p>
</p><p><strong>Norman No-Tax:</strong> I have much respect for teachers like Ms. Environs. However, the conditions she creates in her school orchard do not mimic real life on orchards that span hundreds of acres. As she pointed out herself, her trellises are custom-built. Concord City farmers do not have the time or money to copy her methods.</p>
</p><p><strong>Elaine Environs:</strong> But ten orchards have.</p>
</p><p><strong>Norman No-Tax</strong>: Please, Ms. Environs, the orchards you have worked with are small-scale, like the one at your school. They are not producing grapes as their main source of income. Those of us for whom the grape orchard is everything: our property payments, our children's college, our retirement. We cannot build these trellises or spread the fine-mesh canopies over thousands of grapevines. To begin to use your methods, which yes, I have seen your school orchard and some varieties of grape seem to work with it, farmers would need lower taxes to afford the changes.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Mr. No-Tax's main platform, as city voters understand it, is that the farmers need a break on city taxes. Ms. Republican, your recent ads claim you have lowered taxes. Is it enough?</p>
</p><p><strong>Rita Republican:</strong> First, I would like to mention that through budget changes we have lowered city taxes for all residents. I do not think it fair that Mr. No-Tax focuses only on farmers. We need to consider that this city has teachers, firefighters, police officers, shop owners, resturants. Any change in taxation applies to all, including the farmers. I think Mr. No-Tax lacks a true vision of the size and scope of our great city. That said, I think any further cuts to taxes are only possible by expanding our tax base, meaning increasing the number of people and types of businesses that pay taxes to the city. This is why we need to support the building of an Amazing Grapes factory. The jobs it will bring, the business, these things will expand the tax base and lower the burden on all residents overall.</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: I know when you speak of this factory, the plan is to build it on old Concord field, the unused city land to the north. Is that correct?</p>
</p><p><strong>Rita Republican</strong>: Yes, that's correct. It's time we put that land to work for our city, for our people.</p>
</p><p><strong>David Democrat</strong>: Ah, if I may, Ms. Corker?</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Yes, Mr. Democrat, go ahead.</p>
</p><p><strong>David Democrat</strong>: A factory on that land is going to hurt our city. Amazing Grapes will not buy just the grapes from our farmers, but truck grapes in from other communities. It will be our farmers' sons and daughters going to work in the factory, not new people moving in from elsewhere. The profits gained from the sales of Amazing Grapes products will go into the hands of the business owners, who will not live in our city. It will pull money away from our people, and the tax burden will not change at all. This is why we need a school there. A special high school, geared towards technology. We need to train our students in the types of work that we want to see here in Concord City, to expand opportunities. Ms. Republican says she wants to bring in new types of jobs, but she talks of a factory that processes grape products like our people do now!</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Moderator</strong>: I think now would be a good time to take a question from our residents. I just received this message from Evonna Strainer. She says, &quot;This debate is supposed to distinguish the candidates, but so far they have each managed to still plug their one goal. I do not have an orchard, but my family has been making specialty jams for generations. We buy grapes from local orchards to produce it and advertise that our jams are local. Therefore, the concerns of farmers are also a concern to my family. How can the candidates not talk about the drought? What are we going to do to save our orchards?&quot; Thank you, Evonna, for your question. Ms. Republican, as the mayor in office, would you like to take that first?</p>
</p><p><strong>Rita Republican</strong>: Certainly, Ms. Corker. I do have trust in our farmers and tradition that they will survive this drought. I know many have been installing new irrigation systems, and repairing leaky or rusted pipes. It's unfortunate that it takes a difficult situation such as this to make people realize they need to update their equipment, but it is what it is. Mr. Everpurple, a local farmer, was telling me the other day how thankful he was for the recent tax cuts. He said without them, he would not have been able to install a completely new irrigation system. He is confident that his orchard will come back now to its former grandeur. </p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Mr. No-Tax, as a fellow orchard farmer, do you agree with Ms. Republican? Have you spoken with Mr. Everpurple?</p>
</p><p><strong>Norman No-Tax</strong>: I have, and must say I do not think Ms. Republican has her facts straight. Yes, Mr. Everpurple installed a new system. However, he did not completely pay for it. He is making payments that will stretch over the next ten years at a high interest rate. He will end up paying four times the original cost. So while the tax cut allowed him to make a down payment to install the system, he is worse off. Some of us already had newer systems, and we were still hit hard by the drought. Taxes need to be lower, especially on water. Farmers should not have to pay as much for water service provided by the city. We need much more than usual to keep our vines alive in these conditions. Mr. Everpurple himself is realizing this truth as we speak. </p>
</p><p><strong>Elaine Environs:</strong> I think that I can speak best to this problem, Ms. Corker and Ms. Strainer. See, it's true that proper irrigation is not enough. You are wasting more resources, water, trying to keep the vines alive, and it just evaporates in the heat. This is why the vines need to be planted thicker and covered with the mesh to protect the vines from the afternoon sun. Assisting our orchard owners in making these changes will help them deal with drought in the long run. That's why we need to use Concord field as a large-scale, experimental orchard. We could put the methods of the school orchard to the test at a greater size. Farmers could use healthy plants from the city orchard to jump-start their own orchard. The city could run the orchard and make money to pay for itself as well as increase the city income.</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Mr. Democrat, what do you think needs to be done about the drought?</p>
</p>
<p><strong>David Democrat:</strong> I think the farmers need emergency relief. All the changes my fellow candidates mention take too much time. We need to support our farmers now so they don't lose their orchards or houses. They should not have to worry about where their next meal is coming from as grapes are dying on the vines. We need to take care of our own.</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: And where would this financial relief come from?</p>
</p><p><strong>David Democrat:</strong> It would have to come from the city budget, of course. This is a difficult time for our city, and hopefully, a temporary one. We will need to help those most in need.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>Norman No-Tax</strong>: That sounds great, Mr. Democrat, but you are failing to say the obvious. You want city money for your new school. To help us farmers now as well, you will need to increase taxes. We can't have that. Ms. Environs' plan, despite what she says, will also lead to a tax increase. Starting a city-run orchard? What real value is there in such a thing? Let's experiment on the existing farms we have. There is no sense in forcing us to pay for a whole orchard from which only some will benefit. I notice she also didn't mention how the pay for workers in this city-run orchard would also come from the city budget, from our taxes. </p>
</p><p><strong>Rita Republican:</strong> My fellow candidate Mr. No-Tax talks mostly about reducing the tax burden on farmers. What he has failed to mention, though, is where he would cut city spending. See, I did lower the city's budget by five percent, lowering taxes as a result. However, those changes were difficult. Concord City residents worked hard in meetings to find places we could trim the budget. It's one thing to say you want to cut taxes, but it takes a real leader to admit the changes that will happen as a result.</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Mr. No-Tax, any response?</p>
</p><p><strong>Norman No-Tax</strong>: Well, certainly the high-minded plans of my fellow candidates are not an option. The factory, the school, the city orchard. These are dreams. Right now, we have to take care of our own, as Mr. Democrat said himself. Take care of our farmers, and Concord City will be fine. Our budget can handle some additional tax cuts if we abandon the expensive plans that my fellow candidates propose.</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Mr. Democrat, one city resident heard that you see the mayor's office as a stepping-stone. He says you plan to run for governor of the state soon after taking office if you win the election. How would you respond to our fellow voter?</p>
</p><p><strong>David Democrat:</strong> I would tell the people of Concord City that this is an unfounded rumor. I am deeply committed to this city. I graduated from Concord University. I have worked as a substitute teacher in our schools. I volunteer as an after-school tutor, for no pay. I serve on the school board. To me, becoming mayor is the best opportunity for me to give back even more to the city I love, to make it better. For anyone to think different saddens me.</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator:</strong> One question did come in about experience in our schools. Ms. Environs, do you think your career as a teacher prepares you for the office of mayor?</p>
</p><p><strong>Elaine Environs:</strong> I certainly do! Managing a classroom of teenagers on a day-to-day basis is a great challenge. It is an even greater challenge when your classroom is the outdoors! My students are successful, so I know I can lead the people of our wonderful city as well. I would like to note that Mr. Democrat may be dedicated, but his classroom experience does not compare to mine. He once subbed in my classroom when I was ill. It was utter chaos. Students did not work in the orchard, and the plants suffered. If he cannot handle a classroom of teenagers, he is not ready to be mayor.</p>
</p><p><strong>David Democrat:</strong> Ms. Environs, as you so kindly pointed out, your classroom is not typical! I have had many excellent substitute teaching experiences in all of our schools. </p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Mr. Democrat, please, let's move on from the issue of one substitute experience. I have done it myself and will admit that it's a challenge even under the best of circumstances. Several citizens did mention preparation for leadership as an issue in this election. Mr. Democrat, you are the youngest candidate. Are you prepared to be mayor? </p>
</p><p><strong>David Democrat:</strong> I understand the value that citizens of Concord City place on age and wisdom. However, I think my youth is an advantage at this time in our city. I had an excellent education. I grew up in this city. I know its issues and ideas on how to address them. My fellow candidates are limited in their vision of the future. All they see are grapes and factories. I see an expanding city full of not only grapes but also life! </p>
</p><p><strong>Rita Republican:</strong> And that right there is why Mr. Democrat, idea-filled though he may be, is not ready to be mayor. He did not grow up in the orchards. He never has had the hands-on experience of growing grapes or working directly with the children of those who do. He never volunteered with my police explorers program. He knows only those people as smart and educated as himself, and that is all he values. He has no respect for people who work with their hands, the people who are the lifeblood of this city.</p>
</p><p><strong>Elaine Environs:</strong> Mr. Democrat may be young and inexperienced, but there is value to new ideas. Ms. Republican wants to bring in a factory. No one has pointed out the pollution that would bring to our city. She says the factory will regularly buy our orchards' grapes, sparing farmers the problems of selling grapes before they go bad. However, how will the pollution affect our farmers? Ms. Republican does not mention that she also never worked in an orchard. Her family owns one, but she avoided learning about the grapes and went into law. Some ideas, some change is necessary, and can be done with respect for the livelihoods of the people of Concord City. The factory will ruin the beauty and success of our orchards.</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Ms. Republican, one of our local farmers is concerned that you lack understanding of their concerns. She wants to know whether it is true that you never worked in your family's orchard.</p>
</p><p><strong>Rita Republican</strong>: Of course it's not true. We all helped on the farm, my siblings and I. I just found working as a police officer a greater way to serve the community. My family's orchard does fine without me.</p>
</p><p><strong>Moderator</strong>: Thank you.</p><p><strong> </strong>Well, that is all we have time for tonight. I want to thank each of the candidates for tonight’s debate. The voters of Concord City appreciate your answering their questions. </p>
