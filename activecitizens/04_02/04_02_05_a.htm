<h2><em>Plessy vs. Ferguson</em> Text Version</h2>
<p>The case of <em>Plessy vs. Ferguson</em> was decided in 1896 by the United States Supreme Court. This case started out, there was a gentleman named Mr. Plessy, and he was a black male. Back at the time, the law of the country was that there had to be separate accommodations, like on a railroad. That means if you were white you could only ride on a railcar for white people, and if you were black you could only ride on a railcar for black people. These were the days of segregation.</p>
<p>Mr. Plessy since he was black could not ride in the same railcar as white passengers. And so there was a committee of citizens in Louisiana who decided they were going to contest the validity of Louisiana's law that required people of different races to ride trains in different cars or have separate accommodations. Mr. Plessy went and sat on a train, and he sat in a car that was designated for white passengers. And when he refused to leave he was arrested, and that became the factual background of this case.</p>
<p>In <em>Plessy vs. Ferguson</em>, the United States Supreme Court said that under the Constitution, State Laws that required racial segregation were valid, were okay, as long as the accommodations were separate but equal.</p>
<p>It was interesting though, after this case was decided, the committee of citizens from New Orleans had this quote, and I'll read it to you. Even though they lost the case they realized the fight was not over, and what they said was, "We as free men still believe we were right and our cause is sacred."</p>
