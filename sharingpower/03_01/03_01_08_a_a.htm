<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Place the words in the appropriate place.</p>
<p><strong>Federalism</strong> is the division of powers among local, state, and national governments. The <strong>U.S. Constitution</strong> divides powers between the national government and the states. It delegates powers to the <strong>national</strong> government. The <strong>10th Amendment</strong> reserves powers to the states. <strong>State constitutions</strong> determine the structure and functions of state and local governments. An example of a <strong>delegated</strong> power to the national government is the power to coin and print money. One power the Constitution has <strong>reserved</strong> to the states is the power to establish and support public schools. A <strong>concurrent</strong>, or shared, power listed in the Constitution is the power to raise and collect taxes.</p>
