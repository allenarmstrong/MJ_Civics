<h2>Public Library Text Version</h2><p>Welcome to the Concord City Library! Here you will learn about political parties (people who share beliefs about government and support their members in elections to increase the group's power). You will examine the candidates' websites and learn about their political beliefs. An ideology is a set of beliefs, values, and ideas that form the basis for an organization or program, such as a political party.</p>
<h3>What Do You Think?</h3>
<p>Following is a political ideology survey. Read each statement and decide if you agree or disagree with each.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Government makes too many rules that limit how people run their businesses.</li>
  <li>High government taxes hurt people and businesses more than they help.</li>
  <li> Wealthy people should have to pay a higher percentage of their earnings in taxes than people with low or average earnings.</li>
  <li> Only people who are unable to work should be able to get government help, such as money from the government to pay for groceries.</li>
  <li>The government should create and pay for programs that help poor people.</li>
  <li> The death penalty, or punishment by death for serious crimes, should be banned in all U.S. states.</li>
  <li>Protecting the environment should be a higher priority than the military.</li>
  <li>Government programs that provide money and help to obtain food, work, and college education discourage people from finding ways to help themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you agreed with numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, give yourself one point for Conservative.</p>
  <p>If you agreed with numbers 3, 5, 6, 7, give yourself one point for Liberal.</p>
  <p>If you disagreed with numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, give yourself one point for Liberal.</p>
  <p>If you disagreed with numbers 3, 5, 6, 7, give yourself one point for Conservative.</p>
<p>Add up your total points.</p>

  <p>Based on your answers to this quick survey, it appears you may have a moderate political ideology. Moderates tend to be liberal on some issues and conservative on others. Liberals generally believe that it is the government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure the people&rsquo;s well-being. They tend to increase government programs and taxes to pay for them. Conservatives generally believe that it is the people&rsquo;s own responsibility to ensure their well-being. They tend to limit government programs and taxes. Note that this small survey cannot possibly capture the entire range of political ideas. In addition, people&rsquo;s ideas can change over time. Most U.S. voters are moderate, or they are mostly moderate but might tend to pick one side more often. Candidates compete hardest for moderate votes! Whom a moderate will vote for depends on the specific issues in that election and the candidates&rsquo; plans for them.</p>
<p><strong>If you scored five or more liberal votes:</strong></p>

<p>Ideology is very complex. Dividing into the labels of liberal (believing government is responsible for the well-being of people), moderate (having views somewhere between liberal and conservative depending on the issue), and conservative (believing people are responsible for their own well-being) are helpful to describe political ideology. However, the labels can be misleading because there is much room for variation. </p>
<p>We can use the line image below to show this range in political ideas. For example, two people might be &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; on the survey, but one is a bit more conservative than the other. If you have ever heard a person&rsquo;s views described as &ldquo;to the left,&rdquo; or &ldquo;right of center,&rdquo; then this image explains what was meant. &ldquo;To the left&rdquo; refers to liberal views while &ldquo;to the right&rdquo; refers to conservative views. We sometimes describe moderates as &ldquo;in the center&rdquo; or &ldquo;on the fence&rdquo; because they could lean in either direction. You can also label political parties by their beliefs.</p>

<p>The United States has two major political partiesâ€”the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Each party has a platform (set of policies and promises of a political party) that describes its beliefs, values, and ideas. Members of a political party usually agree with the party platform, though they might have a different view on certain issues. Candidates for office need to capture the votes of as many moderate people as possible. Because most people are moderate, a political party platform will stay away from extreme views if they want to increase their support. For example, the Democratic Party is described as &ldquo;liberal,&rdquo; but in reality they are somewhere between liberal and moderate on our range. The Republican Party has conservative to moderate views.</p>
<p>If your quiz results said &ldquo;conservative,&rdquo; does that mean you are a member of the Republican Party? No. You could agree with a group of people, like a political party, without being a registered member. When a person registers to vote in the United States, they can choose whether to register as a member of a political party. A person who is conservative, for example, may choose to register as a Republican. However, they could choose to register with another party. Ideology is one reason people choose to join, but not the only one. A person might feel strong about one particular issue, enough to join a different party than they normally would simply because they prefer that party&rsquo;s platform on the issue. Registering with a party gives a voter certain rights in particular states. One example is being able to vote in that party&rsquo;s primary election. A primary election is an election a political party holds in order to choose who will run as a candidate for a particular office. For example, imagine 10 different important members of the Republican Party wish to run for president. Each state will hold a &ldquo;Republican primary&rdquo; to see whom voters would most like to see be the official party candidate for president. The political party will then put all its efforts and money into helping the party member that wins the primaries.</p>
<p>Americans are most familiar with the two main parties. Their candidates usually have the most success in elections. Most people identify themselves as a Democrat or Republican. However, there are other political parties. We refer to them as &ldquo;third parties.&rdquo; Third parties form often because a group of people believes that the main parties fail to address or deal with a certain issue. That issue or problem becomes the focus of the third party. Sometimes people call them &ldquo;single-issue&rdquo; parties for that reason. An example is the Green Party of the United States. This party&rsquo;s focus is protecting and preserving the natural environment. Members believe the way big businesses grow and operate is harming Earth and U.S. society in the long term.</p>
<p> Moderates could be members of any political party, depending in part on what issues are most important to them. Some people, of any ideology, run for office as an &ldquo;independent.&rdquo; That means they did not register as a member of a political party. They do not have direct support from a party for their campaign. It is much more difficult to run as an independent because of the money needed to run a successful campaign. Independent candidates usually have more success at winning local government elections than they do in state or federal elections. One reason why is that state and federal campaigns are more expensive to run and win. Yet independent and third-party candidates can have a great impact on any election. They may draw votes away from the main party candidates. </p>
