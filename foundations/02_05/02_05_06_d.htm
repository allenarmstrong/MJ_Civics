<h2>Supreme Court Justices Text Version</h2>
<p>[Narrator] The Supreme Court is the most important court in the country. The Supreme Court is made up of a group of nine people who know a lot about our national laws and the Constitution. These nine people are called "Justices," which means they are people that make fair decisions.</p> 
<p>Our laws and Constitution are the rules that everyone in our country must follow. When there is a question about the Constitution or a national law, the Supreme Court Justices decide what they mean. Supreme Court Justices have their jobs for life. This guarantees that they can make tough decisions without worrying about losing their jobs.</p>  
<p>Most Supreme Court Justices begin their career as lawyers. After practicing law, they become judges. All Supreme Court Justices get their jobs the same wayâ€“the President chooses them.</p>
<p>[President Clinton] I am proud to nomination this fast breaking attorney, advocate and judge, to be the 107th Justice to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p>[Narrator] But before a judge can become a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate must approve the President's choice. The lead justice on the Supreme court is called the "Chief Justice."</p>
