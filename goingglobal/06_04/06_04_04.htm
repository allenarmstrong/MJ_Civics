<h1>Why Should It Matter?</h1>
<p>Three-quarters of Americans watch news to find out the weather. International news may not tell you what to wear. However, it is in our best interest to pay more attention to events around the world. They can affect our lives.</p>
<p>The world's countries are largely <span class="tooltip">interdependent<span><strong>Interdependence:</strong> being unable to exist or survive without each other</span></span>. What happens in one country will affect others. Trade, political agreements, and friendship tie countries together. People are mobile, increasing these ties. They travel for business, <span class="tooltip">immigration<span><strong>Immigration:</strong> the act or process of people entering a new country to live there permanently</span></span>, or recreation. Most countries are members of international organizations that give them certain responsibilities.</p>
<p>If one country has a crisis, it can have effects around the world. Why should people care?</p>
<ul>
  <li>It can interrupt trade and business, affecting economies around the globe.</li>
  <li>A crisis in one country can create safety issues for foreigners.</li>
  <li>It can cause world leaders to question whether their countries should get involved to protect their own interests and people. If they do plan to help, the question is then what they can and should do to help.</li>
  <li>Leaders also worry whether their own people and others around the world will support their plans. What people think about a country's leadership can affect its relationship with others as well. International events are very complex!</li>

<p>In early 2011, people of Egypt held large protests against their government. Many people around the world were concerned about safety there. More than 50,000 Americans were living or visiting Egypt at the time. Many wanted to leave but found it difficult. The events disrupted normal airport schedules. The United States and other countries sent airplanes to remove their citizens to safety.</p>
