<h1>How Are Federal Priorities Determined?</h1>
<p>Remember that Congress and the president represent the people. <span class="tooltip">Interest groups<span><strong>Interest Group:</strong> a group of people with shared goals who work together to influence public policy</span></span>, the <span class="tooltip"> media<span><strong>Media:</strong> the various means of mass communication as a whole group, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the Internet</span></span>, and current issues are some reasons for budget changes. They can change the <span class="tooltip">variable<span><strong>Variable:</strong> amount paid depends on how often or how much the good or service is used, like attending movies or haircuts</span></span> budget items. For example, if scientists predict fewer hurricanes than usual, Congress might decrease the budget for disaster cleanup.</p>
<p>A large portion of the budget is <span class="tooltip">mandatory<span><strong>Mandatory:</strong> needing to be done or followed, usually because of an official requirement such as a law</span></span> spending. For example, paying <span class="tooltip">interest<span><strong>Interest:</strong> rate paid or charged for use of money</span></span> on the national <span class="tooltip">debt<span><strong>Debt:</strong> an amount of money, service, or other property owed to someone</span></span> is set by law. When the government runs a <span class="tooltip">deficit<span><strong>Deficit:</strong> an amount of expenses that exceed income</span></span>, the borrowed money is debt. The cost of borrowing money is interest, which adds up quickly. The federal government includes making payments on the interest to the federal debt.</p>

            <h2>The U.S. Federal Budget</h2> 
            <p>This chart shows a simple breakdown of the federal budget. Notice that the largest portion is for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. 
            These programs are set in law. That means they are mandatory, fixed expenses. The programs provide medical and financial benefits to people who are retired, 
            disabled, or have low income.</p>

			<p>Other mandatory programs include student loans, food stamps, and housing support for low-income families. It includes unemployment benefits for people who 
            lose their jobs. The postal service and protection for bank deposits are also fixed in the budget. Paying the interest on the national debt is a fixed expense 
            as well. Together, you can see that mandatory expenses make up well over half the federal budget!</p>
