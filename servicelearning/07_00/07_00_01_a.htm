<h2>Interview with Bailey Reese of Hero Hugs Text Version (http://www.herohugs.org/)</h2>
<h3>Investigate!</h3>
<h4>What inspired you to begin this project?</h4>
<p>I started Hero Hugs when I was seven years old after hurricane Ivan had just hit and we had no power for about a week and we had to go to ice and water check points where there were soldiers handing out the supplies and I saw people young, the soldiers complaining about the long lines and asking why couldn't they get more supplies so they didn't have to come back as often. And I was really upset by that because those soldiers came from the comforts of their home and left their family ... they didn't have to. So, I think that those people should be appreciative of what they did, because they were just trying to help us. So, I went home with my friends and made cards. And then when I took them back to the soldiers they loved it, and I wanted to keep doing it.</p>
<h4>Why is this issue important?</h4>
<p>I think it's important because the soldiers left their homes to help us and people were being selfish that they couldn't get more. So, they should have been thankful because those soldiers left and they could have stayed where they were and not help us.</p>
<h4>How does this issue affect the community?</h4>
<p>Not having power, water or anything like that for a whole week would be difficult because there would be some people that would not have enough supplies to last them for the week. So, some people could have possibly died. So, having those soldiers come and help saved a lot of lives.</p>
<h3>Plan!</h3>
<h4>What did you have to figure out in order to carry out this project?</h4>
<p>We had to ... first we had to figure how to raise the money. And then we had to figure out who to send the packages to and how many we could send. And, we just had to keep figuring out how to raise the money and the supplies for the packages.</p>
<h4>Who helped you?</h4>
<p>My mom had a friend oversees and he sent us his address. And, ever since he left it's just been ongoing from the people just continuing to give us their address.</p>
<h4>What did you create?</h4>
<p>In the packages: gum, candy, crossword puzzles, books, Oreos, chocolate, gum, hard candy, lollypops, Laughy Taffy.</p>
<h3>Act!</h3>
<h4>What do you do, specifically?</h4>
<p>I do a whole bunch of things. I help decorate the packages. I tell kids all about the organization. I do fundraisers.</p>
<h4>How much time do you put in weekly?</h4>
<p>About twenty hours, depending if we have a fundraiser or not.</p>
<h4>Where do you go?</h4>
<p>We go all around the country to different schools and also go to Walmart and Kmart to do fundraisers.</p>
<h4>Do you ever hear back from people you help?</h4>
<p>Sometimes we hear back from them and sometimes we don't. It depends if they have Internet to send an email or even if they can send a letter.</p>
<h4>What do other people do who are involved?</h4>
<p>Some people send us cards from all over the country. We have kids send us supplies. They help pack the packages, even some help decorate the packages. And we have different kids that just hear about Hero Hugs that send us cards.</p>
<h3>Reflect!</h3>
<h4>Have you changed anything since you began?</h4>
<p>I think we've changed a lot of things. Like now we send a lot more packages out. We raise a lot more money at a fundraiser. We go to a lot of schools now. And we do a lot of packings to teach kids that community service can be a good thing.</p>
<h4>What motivates you to keep going?</h4>
<p>I think what motivates me is that I know I'm helping someone. It makes them feel better about what they are doing and makes them want to keep doing it too.</p>
<h4>What, if anything, would you do differently if you were starting over?</h4>
<p>I don't think I would do anything differently. I think the organization is doing fine.</p>
<h3>Celebrate!</h3>
<h4>How do you spread the word about the work you are doing?</h4>
<p>We spread the word by doing fundraisers. We have a website and a Facebook. And, we go to schools to do packings and do  presentations there so that kids can learn about Hero Hugs.</p>
<h4>Has anyone recognized your for your efforts?</h4>
<p>A lot of people have recognized my efforts. Like, I went to the White House to have a meeting with President Bush. I went to Disneyworld ... Disneyland because I won Disney Adventure All-Stars and the group grand prize was a trip to Disneyland for a week. I won an award from JC Penneys that was $53,000 for my organization and a $53,000 college scholarship for community service.</p>
<h4>What can you tell us about this bear you're holding?</h4>
<p>I send my bear around the world, so kids can see how life is oversees and know that it's not as bad as anyone says it is. That it's actually a good life for them. My bear has been all over. He's been to Iraq, Afganastan, and he comes with us to different air shows that we go to all around the country.</p>
