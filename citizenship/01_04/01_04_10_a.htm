<h2>Option A: Make a Picture</h2>
<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Make a  picture of a place in your area that represents an ecological issue. You may draw or take a photograph. Ask a trusted adult for ideas. Save your image to your computer.</li>
    <li>Create a detailed caption for your picture. In your detailed caption, be sure to answer the following questions:<br /><br />
        What is the issue?<br />
        How is it an ecological issue?<br />
        How does it relate to conservation?<br />
        Why is it a problem in your area?<br />
        How is the government involved in this issue?<br />
        What can citizens do to help?</li>
    <li>Use a map to identify the area(s) in your local community affected by your chosen issue. You may use the map you created for your CAP file. Save your image to your computer.</li>
    <li>Save your map, picture, and caption to one file to turn in.</li>
  </ol>
