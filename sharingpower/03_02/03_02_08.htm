        <h1>Who Is Florida's Top Executive?</h1>
        <p>The executive branch of the United States contains the president, vice president, heads of executive agencies, and many other staff members, such as those in the Florida <span class="tooltip">Cabinet<span><strong>Cabinet:</strong> a group of officials who advise an executive, such as the U.S. Cabinet members who advise the president</span></span>. Florida's executive branch is similar, though the top executive is called the governor.</p>
        <p>The governor serves a four-year term and has a <span class="tooltip">term limit<span><strong>Term Limit:</strong> a restriction in law on the number of terms an official may serve in one position</span></span>. The governor may serve only two terms in a row. He or she can call on the <span class="tooltip">state militia<span><strong>State Militia:</strong> a reserve military force that the state governor can call upon for emergencies</span></span> to help keep the peace. The lieutenant governor for Florida is like the U.S. vice president. He or she is elected to a four-year term and serves as the state's top executive if the governor is absent or can no longer serve.</p>
        <p>The governor shares power with members of the Florida Cabinet. The attorney general is the chief legal officer for the state. The Chief Financial Officer monitors the collecting and spending of state funds. The commissioner of agriculture monitors the safety of food and other products people purchase in Florida. Voters also elect members of the Florida Cabinet. Except for the vice president, the president appoints members of the U.S. Cabinet, and the U.S. Senate approves them. They are not elected.</p>

              <h2>How are they similar of different?</h2>
              <p>Florida's top executive is the governor. The president serves this role for the United States. The vice president takes over for the U.S. president if necessary, and the lieutenant governor fills this role at the state level.</p>
              <p>Notice how the executive at both the state and federal level can require lower officials to make reports to the executive. At both levels, the executive is also in charge of the budget, or plan for raising and spending money.</p>
