<h2>U.S. Dollar Text Version</h2>
<h3>Strong U.S. Dollar</h3>  
<h4>General Intro</h4> 
<p>Let's examine the impact of a strong versus a weak U.S. dollar. The value of one currency affects people within the country as well as those who do business with people in it. For our example, we will look at business people in both the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>When the U.S. dollar is "strong," it is worth more and can buy more foreign products. The country is likely to import more goods and services than it exports. Traveling is less expensive for Americans. They can get more for their U.S. dollars like food and hotel rooms. Let's look at what a strong dollar means for businesses that depend on trade.</p>
<h4>U.S. Importer (Image: U.S. Importer)</h4>
<p>Hi, my name is Tom. I am a U.S. importer. Importers sell products from other countries. When the dollar is strong, foreign products cost less for American importers. We benefit by making more profit. The American customers can benefit if the U.S. importers pass on the savings through lower prices.</p>
<p>I sell oil from Mexico to U.S. companies. Therefore, when the dollar is strong, the oil from Mexico costs less for me. This helps my business because I can make more profit when I sell the oil. I can charge the U.S. companies less for the oil.</p>
<h4>U.S. Exporter (Image: U.S. Exporter)</h4>
<p>Hi, my name is Brianne. I am a U.S. exporter. Exporters sell what their own country produces to other countries. As an American exporter, I do not prefer a strong U.S. dollar. It makes American products more expensive for foreign businesses because they get less U.S. dollars for their currencies. The foreign businesses will demand less U.S. products. This hurts the American exporters' businesses because sales are down.</p>
<p>I sell automobile parts to companies in Mexico. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar is strong, this hurts my business because it makes the parts more expensive for my customers in Mexico. My sales are down because they buy fewer parts.</p>
<h4>Mexican Importer (Image: Mexican Importer)</h4>
<p>Hi, my name is Juan. I am a Mexican importer. Mexican importers buy U.S. products from the American exporters. Remember, a strong dollar means we get less U.S. dollars for our Mexican pesos. We are less likely to buy U.S. products because they are more expensive. We will compare costs with other countries that offer the same product, looking for a better deal. </p>
<p>I sell automobile parts made in the United States to customers in Mexico. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar is strong, the parts are more expensive for my customers and me. My business is hurt because sales are down. I buy fewer parts to sell.</p>
<h4>Mexican Exporter (Image: Mexican Exporter)</h4>
<p>Hi, my name is Amada. I am a Mexican exporter. Mexican exporters sell Mexican products to the U.S. importer. A strong dollar benefits foreign exporters. It makes our own products less expensive for our U.S. customers, so our sales go up.</p>
<p>I sell oil produced in Mexico to U.S. companies. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar is strong, my oil is less expensive for my U.S. customers. They buy more, and my business benefits.</p>
<h3>Weak U.S. Dollar</h3>
<h4>General Intro</h4>
<p>When the U.S. dollar is "weak," it is worth less and buys fewer foreign products. The country is likely to import fewer goods and services than it exports. Traveling is more expensive for Americans.  Their U.S. dollars won't buy as much when buying things like food and hotel rooms. Let's look at what a weak dollar means for businesses that depend on trade.</p>
<h4>U.S. Importer (Image: U.S. Importer)</h4>
<p>Hi there! It's me again, Tom. <p>When the U.S. dollar is weak, that means it costs more for Americans to import products. They get less foreign currency for each U.S. dollar. The prices for imported goods and services will increase.</p>
<p>Since I sell oil produced in Mexico, a weak U.S. dollar hurts my business. It costs me more to import the oil, and I have to charge my American customers more. They buy less as a result, and my sales go down.</p>
<h4>U.S. Exporter (Image: U.S. Exporter)</h4>
<p>Hi again! It's me, Brianne. A weak U.S. dollar makes American products less expensive to foreign businesses. They will buy more, and the U.S. exporter benefits from increased sales. The greater demand means more goods and services are produced so there are more jobs for Americans.</p>
<p>A weak U.S. dollar is great for me since it makes the automobile parts I sell less expensive for my Mexican customers. My sales are up!</p>
<h4>Mexican Importer (Image: Mexican Importer)</h4>
<p>Hello againâ€“Juan here. Mexican importers benefit from a weak U.S. dollar. They buy U.S. products to sell in Mexico. Since they need fewer pesos for each dollar, American goods are less expensive for them. They buy more and can pass the savings on to their customers.</p>
<p>Since I sell automobile parts from the United States to customers here in Mexico, a weak U.S. dollar is great for me. The parts are less expensive for me to buy, and I can pass on the savings to my customers through lower prices.</p> 
<h4>Mexican Exporter (Image: Mexican exporter)</h4>
<p>It's me again, Amada. A Mexican exporter sells Mexican products to the United States and other countries. A weak U.S. dollar means that Mexican products are more expensive for their customers, the U.S. importers. Sales will decrease for the Mexican exporter.</p>
<p>A weak U.S. dollar hurts my business. Since I sell Mexican oil to American customers, the oil is more expensive for them. They will buy less, and so I sell less oil.</p>
