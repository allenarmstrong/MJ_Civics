<h1>How Is Florida's Judicial Branch Structured?</h1>
<p>Florida's judicial branch is also similar to that of the United States. Most citizens who go to court will appear in a county court. Each of Florida's 67 counties has a county court with an elected judge. The state attorney prosecutes cases against those accusing of breaking Florida law. Public defenders work as lawyers for citizens who need but cannot afford a lawyer.</p>
<p>Circuit courts are higher than county courts. Depending on state law, some cases are heard first in a circuit court, such as disputes over more than $15,000 or jury trials for serious crimes. Florida has 20 circuit courts.</p>
<p>Citizens who appeal their cases will go to one of Florida's five District Courts of Appeal, or DCA for short. A three-judge panel reviews cases in a DCA.</p>
<p>The Florida Supreme Court, in Tallahassee, is the highest court in the state. The governor appoints six justices and one chief justice, who all serve six-year terms. They are the final decision makers on matters of Florida law. All lower courts in the state must abide by their decisions. U.S. Supreme Court justices are appointed by the president, approved by the U.S. Senate, and serve for life.</p>
