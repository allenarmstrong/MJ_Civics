<h2>Work Together Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Two kids are competing from their lemonade stand.</p>
<p>A girl is setting up a lemonade stand at the next house down from a boy's lemonade stand. The boy looks surprised.</p>
<p>The girl sets a lower price than the boy, more customers at her stand.</p>
<p>The boy puts out sign "Only fresh, organic lemons used here!" and now more customers are at his stand.</p>
<p>The girl walks over to boy and says, "Maybe we should work together. I bet we could make and sell more lemonade together than we can apart." The boy looks like he is considering the offer.</p>
