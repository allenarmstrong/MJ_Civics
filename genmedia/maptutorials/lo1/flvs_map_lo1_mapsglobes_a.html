  <h2>How Can We Represent the Earth?</h2>
  <p>Lesson 1 of 7:</p>
  <p>Because we cannot all be astronauts, we use pictures to represent Earth. When we study Earth and its features, we typically use either a <strong>map</strong>, which is a flat representation of Earth, or a <strong>globe</strong>, which is a model of Earth. Both have advantages and disadvantages. The one we choose to use for studying Earth depends on our purpose for study.</p>

  <h2>Model</h2>
  <p>Lesson 2 of 7:</p>
  Perhaps you have built or seen a model car, railroad, or building. <strong>Models</strong>, or a copy of an object usually built on a smaller scale, are smaller versions of something very large we wish to study or create. Most models have accurate <strong>scale</strong>, which is a size ratio, such as 1 unit equaling 50 units in the original object. For example, if you could magically enlarge a model car, the relative size of the tires and other parts would match the original car. A globe is the most accurate representation of Earth you can study because it is built to scale and mimics Earth's shape.</p>

  <h2>Globes in Action</h2>
  <p>Lesson 3 of 7:</p>
  <p>View this animation to see a globe in action.</p>
  <p><em>Image of a young boy looking at a globe; he studies it from all sides. He spins the globe. Not convinced that this is the best way to see all of Earth at once, he then picks the globe up, carries it down the street, and sets it on the road so a steamroller can flatten it and turn it into a two-dimensional map.</em></p>

  <h2>Maps</strong></h2>
  <p>Lesson 4 of 7:</p>
  <p>As the steamroller smashed the globe, you probably imagined that a flat representation of the earth has advantages over a globe. However, notice that the flattened globe is not pretty to look at nor would it be easy to use for study.</p>
  <p>The surface of the earth curves. Maps are flat representations of the earth. They are not as accurate as globes because you cannot flatten a globe without causing tears and curls in the paper. The <strong>cartographer</strong>, which is a person who makes maps, also must determine where to split the image of the earth, which will show at the edges of the map even though those areas actually touch. All maps have <strong>distortion</strong>, or an alteration of an object's natural shape.</p>
<p><em>Image of the same boy from Lesson 3 holding the steam-rolled globe in his hands; he is shocked at how distorted the globe looks now. There is a map of the United States hanging in the background.</em></p>

  <h2>Contrasting</h2>
  <p>Lesson 5 of 7:</p>
  <p> Maps are easier to carry. In addition, unlike globes, you can see all of Earth at one time on a world map. Maps can zoom in on a specific area to show more details than can fit on a globe. For example, you might have a road map for your state. Maps are easier to make than globes and can suit limitless purposes.</p>
  <p><em>Image of a map of the world with a particular section of the United States shown in a box off to the side; the box contains a zoomed-in view of this section with street names, route numbers, roads, and waterways. When you click on the box, an even more zoomed-in version appears, allowing you to see the map features in even greater detail.</em></p>

  <h2>Comparing</h2>
  <p>Lesson 6 of 7:</p>
  <p>    Both maps and globes have the ability to show <strong>political</strong> (concerned with government) and <strong>physical</strong> (real and touchable) features. Political features are man-made and include national boundaries and city locations. Physical features include bodies of water, such as seas, and landforms, such as deserts. Globes have the added benefit of using &quot;raised relief&quot; so you can feel mountain ranges and other land elevations. As nations sign treaties and cities grow, globes and maps can change to show changes in political features. People around the world recognize and use both globes and maps.</p>
  <p><em>Image displaying two types of maps and one raised relief global image. The political map includes the countries and associated waters of Europe. The physical map includes a view of mountains, grasslands, and rivers spanning several U.S. states. The &quot;raised relief&quot; physical globe image shows someone touching the elevated surface of the globe, which protrudes outward to give a better understanding of the physical features of Earth.</em></p>
