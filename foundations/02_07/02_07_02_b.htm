<h2>Tinker Armband Text Version</h2>
<p>In 1965, Mary Beth Tinker and John Tinker wore these armbands to school. The armbands had two meanings for them. One was to mourn those who died in the Vietnam conflict going on at the time. The other meaning was the hope for peace and a quick end to the conflict. Adults including their parents also wore the armbands.</p>
<p>The Tinkers were suspended from school for wearing the armbands. The school banned the armbands before the Tinkers wore them there. However, the students and their parents believed they had the right to free speech in school, just as they would anywhere else. At first, their parents challenged the school board's rule in their state court. Each time they lost the case, they challenged the ruling. Eventually, their case went to the Supreme Court!</p>
