<h1>How Did Ancient Greece and Rome Influence American Leaders?</h1>
<p>Two important ideas about government came from the ancient Greeks and Romans. Each of these ideas describes a method for making political decisions in a society, such as creating laws.</p>
<p>Direct democracy is a form of government where laws are made directly by the citizens. A republic is a form of government where citizens elect <span class="tooltip">representatives<span><strong>Representatives:</strong> a person chosen to speak and act for their fellow citizens in government</span></span> to make laws and decisions. As a group, the elected representatives make up the <span class="tooltip">legislative branch<span><strong>Legislative branch:</strong> the part of government responsible for making laws</span></span>. Examine the images for more details about these ideas.</p>
<p>Enlightenment thinkers and American leaders wrote about and discussed these forms of government. Many believed that combining these ideas in some way could provide a better government for all people.</p>

	<div class="indent"><h2>Direct Democracy</h2>
	<ul>
    	<li>In direct democracy, citizens vote directly on laws and other issues.</li>
    	<li>The people of ancient Greece were the first to practice direct democracy.</li>
    	<li>Direct democracy can work for a local area, like a small town.</li>
    	<li>Some towns in the Northeast United States still have &quot;town meetings&quot; where citizens vote in person on issues.</li>
    </ul>

	<h2>Republic</h2>
	<ul>
    	<li>In a republic, citizens elect representatives. The elected individuals represent the voters and make decisions on their behalf.</li>
    	<li>The people of ancient Rome had a republic form of government for many years.</li>
    	<li>A republic can work for a large area or population, where not enough time or space exists for every citizen to vote on every issue.</li>
    	<li>The federal government of the United States today is a republic. Citizens vote for representatives to meet in Congress, which is the name for the U.S. legislative branch. They vote on national issues and laws.</li>
     </ul>
