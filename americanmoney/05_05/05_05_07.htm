<h1>What Happens If People Decide to Not Pay Taxes?</h1>
<p>As you saw in the chart, the government spends money on services to the people. The programs support the <span class="tooltip">economy<span><strong>Economy:</strong> the production and use of goods and services in a society</span></span> and benefit the <span class="tooltip">common good<span><strong>Common Good:</strong> the greatest possible conditions of society for the greatest number of people living in it</span></span>. Without taxes, governments would not have revenue to support these programs. If people did not pay taxes,  the military, health care, education, and other programs would not exist.</p><p>In fact, early leaders of the United States learned this lesson. The early federal government could not collect taxes. It depended on state governments to give money willingly for federal support. Donations were small or did not happen at all, and problems quickly followed. The new nation had no military to protect it, for example.</p>
<p>Most taxpayers would like to keep as much of their earnings as possible. Government leaders are challenged to minimize the amount of taxes people pay but maximize the services most in demand. They must understand what services the people need and create budgets that include enough tax revenue to meet those needs. While taxpayers often cannot see a direct connection between what they pay in taxes and exactly what it pays for, each taxpayer helps the government provide important services.</p>
<p>This image is just a sample of the taxes a household may pay to government.</p>

<p>The types of taxes and amounts paid in taxes vary from place to place and year to year. For example, some states have an income tax while others do not. A local government might increase the property tax rate while another lowers it. In general, though, people can expect a significant portion of income to go to taxes.</p>
