<h1>How Do Antitrust Laws Affect Business?</h1>

<p>In the late 1800s, Standard Oil was one of a few large companies called "trusts." Standard Oil controlled most of the U.S. market for oil. It owned the companies throughout many states responsible for production and transport of oil. The owners grew more rich and powerful as they expanded Standard Oil's control of the oil market.</p>
<p>Many Americans were angry at Standard Oil's growth. Some who tried to start their own oil refinery either sold the business to Standard Oil or closed when they could not compete in prices. Standard Oil would lower its prices in an area where there was competition to drive other companies out of business. Standard Oil also arranged secret deals with the railroads to transport their oil at lower cost. None of these actions was illegal until Congress passed the <span class="tooltip">Sherman Antitrust Act<span><strong>Sherman Antitrust Act:</strong> federal legislation from 1890 outlawing actions that lead to the creation of a monopoly</span></span>. Congress recognized the need to protect business competition in a mixed economy. When a company has competition, prices are more fair and the company actively seeks to improve quality.</p>
<p>The public demanded action on Standard Oil. The government charged the company with violating antitrust law. It said that Standard Oil used unfair practices that limited competition. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed in 1911, and Standard Oil was forced to break up into 34 separate companies. The owners had to sell large portions of their stakes to others. Standard Oil itself no longer exists. However, many of the companies formed by the breakup do, such as ExxonMobil.</p>
