<p>The people of a colony near the United States are under the rule of a faraway country. You hear reports that the ruling country treats its people badly and they want independence. The people have revolted and set up their own government. Violence erupted between those loyal to the ruling country and the rebels. You sent a battleship to stay nearby to protect Americans staying there. The ruling country is angry that the United States seems to support the revolt. Then you receive news that the U.S. battleship suffered an explosion and sunk.</p>

Your military and leaders have been in the southern country, helping it set up a democratic government. A rival country to the United States has helped set up a communist government in the northern country. Now the communist leadership is intent on reuniting the countries under its government.
