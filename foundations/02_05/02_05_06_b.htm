<h2>The Differences Text Version</h2>
<p>The founders of our country made the House of Representatives and the Senate different for a reasonâ€“they wanted them to act as checks and balances on each other. The founders believed that people in the House of Representatives should be elected for two years. That way, the representatives would know the immediate needs and views of the people they represent.</p>
<p>The founders decided to have senators elected for six years. That way the senators don't have to worry about being re-elected very often. This allows them more time to concentrate on their work in the Senate.</p> 
<p>The House can act quickly to pass bills that the majority of Representatives want to have passed. A bill is a proposed or suggested law. It is easier to get a bill passed in the House because the minority of Representatives that disagree with the bill have little chance of changing it.</p> 
<p>The Senate is designed to work slowly. They discuss each part of a bill in detail and consider how it will affect the nation. In the Senate, the minority can make sure their side on a bill is heard. They can even cause a bill to be changed.</p> 
<p>The Senate has a duty that the House of Representatives doesn't. The Senate approves the President's choices for judges, ambassadors and cabinet members.</p>
