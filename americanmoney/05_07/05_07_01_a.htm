<h2>Conversation Text Version</h2>
<p>Photo of two young adults, both have same new TV, one is happy the other is sad. You find out the happy one saved money until she could purchase with cash, the other used credit and we see the original cost vs. the final cost of principal plus interest and he's got payments for years on end.</p>
<p>[Girl] I am so glad I saved my money! I worked hard to earn this TV. Now I can simply focus on enjoying it.</p>
<p>[Boy] Oh man, I wish I had saved up instead of buying this TV with a bank loan. I can only afford to pay a little each month. It will take years to pay off, and I will end up spending three times the original price for it!</p>
