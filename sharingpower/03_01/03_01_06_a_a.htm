<h2>Phone Multiple Choice: Answers Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Each situation is an imagined public problem. Imagine you face each problem. Whom would you call? Choose the appropriate level of government to address the situation: County Commissioner (Local), State Representative (State), or Member of Congress (National)</p>
<ol>
  <li>Roads in your neighborhood are full of potholes. Riding through a pothole by accident damages your bike tires. You have replaced your bike tires twice in the last three months because of potholes. Your friends have stopped riding altogether out of frustration. Whom do you call?<br /><br />
    <strong>County Commissioner (Local)</strong>: Yes! Local governments are usually responsible for maintaining local roads, such as the roads where people live.<br /><br />
State Representative (State): Oops! While state governments are in charge of transportation, usually they build and maintain routes that extend over a large portion of the state. Local governments are usually in charge of maintaining local roads, such as roads where people live.<br /><br />
Member of Congress (National): Oops! The national government builds interstate highways, but maintenance is the job of the states. Local governments are usually in charge of maintaining local roads, such as roads where people live.</li>
  <li>A tornado damages five counties in Central Florida. It cuts out electric power to more than a million people. Whom do you call?<br /><br />
  County Commissioner (Local): Oops! The County Commissioner and other local leaders are probably already on the phone, or perhaps cleaning their own yards. The damage extends beyond the local community. Someone at the state level will need to help coordinate cleanup efforts.<br /><br /> 
<strong>State Representative (State)</strong>: Yes! The state government would likely take control of this situation. It involves many local governments across an area of the state.<br /><br /> 
Member of Congress (National): Oops! While the state government may call for national assistance if the damage is extreme, the national government may not be involved. The damage does not affect multiple states.</li>
  <li>People in your area often let their dogs run free. Sometimes the dogs chase you and your friends. Today, one growled at you. Whom do you call?<br /><br />
  <strong>County Commissioner (Local)</strong>: Yes! Local governments would handle a local issue such as this one, which likely calls for passing or enforcing a local requirement for all dogs to be on a leash.<br /><br /> 
State Representative (State): Oops! Animal control is generally a local issue. This situation likely calls for passing or enforcing a local requirement for all dogs to be on a leash.<br /><br />
Member of Congress (National): Oops! Animal control is generally a local issue. This situation likely calls for passing or enforcing a local requirement for all dogs to be on a leash.</li>
  <li>You live in a beachside city that is a popular vacation spot for people from several nearby states. Unfortunately, all the visitors who come to enjoy the beach crowd the streets of your city as well as the streets of surrounding cities and towns. The crowding causes terrible traffic throughout the region during certain times of year. You believe a new interstate highway should be built to relieve the traffic. Whom do you call?<br /><br />
  County Commissioner (Local): Oops! While the local government usually maintains local roads, an interstate highway would involve more than just your local area. The national government has the power to build interstate highways that cross state lines.<br /><br />
State Representative (State): Oops! While the state government is in charge of maintaining highways within the state, building a new one that crosses other states is not a decision for just your state to make. The national government has the power to build interstate highways which cross state lines.<br /><br />
<strong>Member of Congress (National)</strong>: Yes! The national government has the power to build new interstate highways. The states themselves, however, will have to maintain the portion of the highway lying within the state.</li>
  <li>Your state constitution allows local governments to create sports programs for youth. However, it does not allow the collection of taxes to support them. The fields in your area are in poor condition, and the program suffers from low participation. You wish to change the state constitution to allow the state to raise and collect taxes to fund these programs. Whom do you call?<br /><br />
  County Commissioner (Local): Oops! Because you need a change at the state level to solve this problem, local leaders can only offer you support for your idea. They do not have the power to make this type of change. It requires state-level action.<br /><br />
<strong>State Representative (State)</strong>: Yes! A change to the state constitution requires action at the state level. You can study the state constitution and state laws to find out how to place the issue before voters in the next election.<br /><br />
Member of Congress (National): Oops! This is a state-level issue. National leaders can offer support for your idea but not action that will result in the change you want. It requires state-level action.</li>
  <li>You ride your bike to a local store and lock it up while you go inside. When you come out, your bike is gone! Someone cut the lock off and stole your bike. Whom do you call?<br /><br />
  <strong>County Commissioner (Local)</strong>: Yes! You would report the theft of personal property to local law enforcement officers. They would investigate the loss of your bike.<br /><br />
State Representative (State): Oops! State leaders may offer you sympathy but are unlikely to get involved in investigating a local crime such as this one.<br /><br />
Member of Congress (National): Oops! National officials address very serious crimes, especially those that cross state lines. They may offer you sympathy but are unlikely to get involved in investigating a local crime such as this one.</li>
