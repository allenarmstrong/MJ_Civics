<h2>Election Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Al Gore requested a recount in four Florida counties. From North to South, the counties are Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade. The counties of Duval, Brevard, and Hillsborough's details are available for comparison. Can you determine why Al Gore might have selected these counties in particular?</p>
<p><strong>Volusia (recount requested)</strong><br>
  Total population (2000)—443,343<br>
  Total votes cast—183,674 <br>

  <p><strong>Broward County (recount requested)</strong><br>
    Total population (2000)—1,623,018<br>
    Total votes cast—575,239<br>
    Popular vote–30.93% Bush, 67.41% Gore</p>
  <p><strong>Miami-Dade County (recount requested)</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Hillsborough County</strong><br>

  <p><strong>Brevard County</strong><br>

    Total votes cast—218,488<br>
    Popular vote–Bush 52.75%, Gore 44.55%</p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>All seven counties have large populations and numbers of total votes. Notice how three of the counties where Gore requested a recount all have a million or more people. Gore won the popular vote in each county where he wanted a recount. In the other counties shown here, Bush won the popular vote by a large number of votes. Since the election was so close, the recount of Florida votes would end up determining the winner. Gore could conclude that these four counties were the most likely to hold the additional votes needed for him to win the election. They had a large number of voters and the results showed that a majority in each county did support Gore.</p>
