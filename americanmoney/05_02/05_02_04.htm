<h1>What Motivates an Entrepreneur?</h1>
<p>An entrepreneur starts a business to make a <span class="tooltip">profit<span><strong>Profit:</strong> what remains after you subtract your total costs from your income</span></span>. Profits are not guaranteed, however. It depends on whether people are interested in the product or service for sale, which can change at any time. An entrepreneur takes the risk that the business might fail.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs have many <span class="tooltip">incentives<span><strong>Incentive:</strong> something that encourages a person to make a choice or take action</span></span> to work hard so that their businesses will succeed. Each person can have different motivations, beyond making a living and earning profit. Perhaps one person's incentive is to improve his or her community by offering a delivery service for less than other businesses charge. Another person knows the community needs a place to sell used furniture, as none exists. <span class="tooltip">Competition<span><strong>Competition:</strong> actions of two or more rivals to sell or buy goods or services</span></span>, or lack of it, motivates each of these individuals.</p>
<p>Examine these American entrepreneurs to identify their incentives.</p>
