<h1>What Is Credit?</h1>
<p>Most people think of credit cards when you say "credit." In fact, many types of credit exist. Besides cards, credit can be in the form of a loan, or a credit account through a bank or store. No matter what type or form of credit a person uses, it represents money owed.</p>
<p>Money from an item purchased on credit must come from somewhere.  The bank, store, or other company that offered the credit charges a fee to cover a person's <span class="tooltip">debt<span><strong>Debt:</strong> an amount of money, service, or other property owed to someone</span></span> until they pay it back. We call this fee <span class="tooltip">interest<span><strong>Interest:</strong> rate paid or charged for use of money</span></span>. If a person does not pay off the credit debt right away, interest adds to the debt and it grows over time. The longer a person takes to pay off the debt, the more interest they will pay, such as the student who bought the TV on credit.</p>
<p>Many Americans obtain bank loans to buy very expensive items like cars and homes. A <span class="tooltip">mortgage<span><strong>Mortgage:</strong> a loan for purchasing a home or property</span></span> is a special type of credit specific to buying homes and property. College students can apply for student loans that have low interest fees. Credit can be <span class="tooltip">secured<span><strong>Secured:</strong> a type of credit where you pay a deposit and can only use card up to that amount</span></span> or <span class="tooltip">unsecured<span><strong>Unsecured:</strong> a type of credit that does not require a deposit and the lender sets the balance limit</span></span>. A person who has an excellent record of paying off debt on time can qualify for unsecured credit.</p>
