  <h2>How can we use maps to show change?</h2>
  <p>Lesson 1 of 5:</p>
  <p>    Examine this animation for changes in the hurricane.</p>
  <p><br />
  Screen 1 of 5:</p>
  <p><em>Image of map titled &quot;Hurricane Tracking Map.&quot; The map shows mostly a body of water with a small portion of the southeastern United States. A yellow line appears from the southeast corner of the map and has a red, spinning circle with arms. This marks the storm's track and is labeled &quot;Tropical Storm; Wind: 40Kts; 28° N, 63°W; W at 15 mph.&quot;</em></p>
<p>1. Review each point in this hurricane's history. Ask yourself, &quot;What changes happened at this point?&quot;</p>
<p><br />
  Screen 2 of 5:</p>
<p><em>Image uses the same elements as Screen 1 but the line has now started to change from yellow to red in color. A second marking shows the next point of the storm's track and is labeled, &quot;Cat 1 Hurricane; Wind: 65 Kts; 29.5° N, 67° W; NW at 12 mph.&quot;</em></p>
<p>2. Notice that the position of the hurricane changes. The size also changes, indicated by the extent of the hurricane-force winds.</p>
<p><br />
  Screen 3 of 5:</p>
<p><em>Image uses the same elements as Screen 2. A third marking shows the next point of the storm's track and is labeled, &quot;Cat 2 Hurricane; Wind: 90 Kts; 31.4° N, 71.5° W; NW at 16 mph.&quot;</em></p>
<p>3. Notice that the direction and speed of the hurricane changes. This information helped experts predict the hurricane's path and warn people in appropriate areas.</p>
<p><br />
  Screen 4 of 5:</p>
<p><em>Image uses the same elements as Screen 3. A fourth marking shows the next point of the storm's track and is labeled, &quot;Cat 3 Hurricane; Wind: 110 Kts; 35° N, 75° W; N/NW at 13 mph.&quot;</em></p>
<p>4. Notice that the maximum sustained winds and storm category change with each point.</p>
<p><br />
  Screen 5 of 5:</p>
<p><em>Image uses the same elements as Screen 4. A fifth marking shows the next point of the storm's track and is labeled, &quot;Tropical Depression; Wind: 30 Kts; 38.3° N, 74° W; N at 11 mph.&quot;</em></p>
<p>5. Natural and human-made features of Earth change over time. We can use technology to show these changes, like in this animation.</p>

  <h2>Different Time, Different Map</h2>
  <p>Lesson 2 of 5:</p>
  <p>    Satellite images and aerial photography give us a bird's-eye view of Earth. Combining the images with map features and labels gives us an accurate map. Comparing these images from different points in time gives us the most real information about changes to Earth, whether physical or human-made.</p>
  <p>The Great Salt Lake in Utah shows both natural and human-made changes. Compare these images for changes over time.</p>
<p>Screen 1 of 2:</p>
<p><em>Image of a map titled &quot;Salt Lake 1972.&quot; The map shows a land mass with a large white section on the west labeled as a &quot;Basin.&quot; To the east of the basin we see a large body of water which is labeled as &quot;Lake.&quot; The lake has color differences to the northern and southern sections; the north  is a lighter blue than the south.</em></p>
<p>Screen 2 of 2:</p>
<p><em>Image uses the same elements as screen 1 but is titled &quot;Salt Lake 1987.&quot; The lake body has expanded greatly and now appears to flow into the basin. There is also a new body of land in the southern lake section.</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, there are four yellow dots on this map and they also appear on screen 1 in the same locations. A dot appears in the basin, it reads, &quot;The creation of an evaporation basin to the west increased the surface area of the lake. Evaporation is the only outlet for the lake - flooding in the 1980s caused damage.&quot; A second dot appears in the northern section of the lake, it reads, &quot;Notice the vast expansion of the lake due to heavy rains in the 1980s.&quot; A third dot appears at the area of the lake's color differences, it reads, &quot;The railroad causeway makes the north end of the lake saltier because of improper mixing of the waters due to the causeway.&quot; Finally a fourth dot appears in the southern section of the lake, it reads, &quot;Antelope Island becomes a peninsula when the water level is low.&quot;</em></p>

  <h2>Growth</h2>
  <p>Lesson 3 of 5:</p>
  <p>Cartographers can also show change over time within one map. As a city's population grows, people spread out and build new structures. Examine the urban growth surrounding Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital.</p>
  <p><em>Image of a map titled &quot;Growth of Washington, D.C. Area.&quot; A key shows the color red represents the year 1900, the color yellow represents 1950, and the color green represents 1990. Washington is represented on the map with the three colors. 1900 is a small red dot, 1950 is a small ring which surrounds the red dot, and 1990 is a much larger ring surrounding the ring for 1950. A body of water is also named &quot;Chesapeake Bay&quot; to the east. The rings do not touch the bay.</em></p>

  <h2>Movement</h2>
  <p>Lesson 4 of 5:</p>
  <p>Maps can show movement of people or things through arrows or other types of lines. Examine how this map uses arrows to show troop movements during the Korean War.</p>
  <p><em>Image of a map titled &quot;The Korean War 1950-1953.&quot; China is labeled in the northwest corner and North Korea conects to the southeast corner of China. South Korea is attached to the south of North Korea and they are both  surrounded by water on the east and west. The 38th parallel divides North and South Korea, making the border between the two countries.</em></p>
<p><em>Cities are labeled, Chongjin in northeast of North Korea and Pyongyang in the southeast; Seoul in the northwest of South Korea, and Pohang in the southeast. A text box directs our attention to an arrow of troop movement and notes that the direction of the arrow shows direction of movement of troops involved in the war. A map key shows red for Chinese troop movement, green for North Korea troop movement, and blue for U.S./U.N. troop movement. </em></p>
<p><em>A trio of red arrows moves from China into the Koreas, one in central North Korea, the others into the northern region of South Korea, near Seoul. There are three green arrows moving from North Korea into South Korea. We also see three blue arrows near Pohang, two moving north from southern South Korea to meet the North Korean troops and another from the eastern body of water. There are also two more blue arrows coming from the western body of water entering northern and central South Korea below Seoul. The last blue arrow is moving into central North Korea from the eastern body of water.</em></p>
